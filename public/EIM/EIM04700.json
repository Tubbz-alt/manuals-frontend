From 6 April 2006 Section 308 has applied to registered pension schemes generally, following an amendment by sections 201(2) and 284 FA 2004.  Its application in relation to registered pension schemes was further amended by section 11 FA 2013 for the tax year 2013/14 onwards.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM01570.htm#top)\n\n\n## Registered pension schemes: general\n\nRegistered pension schemes receive significant tax advantages: For example, Part 4 of FA 2004 (together with supporting schedules and related regulations) provides that their investment income is not taxed, contributions to such schemes qualify for tax relief up to a point, and lump sum benefits (not pensions) are also exempt from tax up to certain limits.\n\nYou may also have heard of approved pension schemes or exempt approved schemes. These were the predecessors of registered pension schemes.  However, from 6 April 2006, the system of HMRC granting such approval was replaced with a registration system.  Most existing approved schemes automatically became registered pension schemes on that day.\n\nRegistered pension schemes include both occupational and personal pension schemes, as well as other types of pension scheme.\n\nThere is detailed guidance available in the Registered Pension Scheme Manual (RPSM) though mostly this is for Pension Schemes Services in Specialist PT; the Employment Income Manual does not deal directly with registered pension schemes.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM01570.htm#top)\n\n\n## Registered pension schemes: employer&#x2019;s contributions for employees\n\nEmployer contributions to a registered pension scheme in respect of an employee are not chargeable on the employee as earnings of the employment (Section 308 ITEPA 2003).\n\nIn practice this means the employer contribution must be used to fund:\n\n*   the provision of benefits for the employee, and/or\n*   benefits payable (actually or contingently) on the death of the employee.\n\nThe provision of death-in-service benefits, such as a lump sum payable on the death of the employee, is an example of where employer contributions are, or may be, used to provide benefits payable (actually or contingently) on the death of the employee.\n\nHowever, an employer contribution to a registered pension scheme in relation to an employee in the following circumstances is not regarded as &#x2018;in respect&#x2019; of an employee for the purpose of the exemption in Section 308 ITEPA 2003.  The circumstances are where:\n\n*   the employer pays contributions to members of the employee&#x2019;s family or household&#x2019;s own arrangements under a registered pension scheme (i.e. the arrangement is not for the provision of benefits following the death of the employee as described immediately above), and\n*   the member of the employee&#x2019;s family or household is not an employee of the employer.\n\nSuch a contribution to the member of the employee&#x2019;s family or household&#x2019;s own pension arrangement will be chargeable on the employee as earnings of the employment.\n\nThe contribution will be treated as earnings under the benefits code (see [EIM20001](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM20001.htm)).\n\nThe exemption under Section 307 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM21800](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM21800.htm)) will not apply.  This is because the cost incurred by the employer is not for the provision of a pension or similar benefit that will be paid or given to the employee or for a pension or similar benefit that will be given to the member of the employee&#x2019;s family or household in the event of the employee&#x2019;s death.\n\nNote - the requirement for the employer contribution to be in respect of the employee in order for the contribution not to be chargeable on the employee as earnings of the employment applies for the tax year 2013/14 onwards.\n\nFor the tax years 2006/07 to 2012/13 there is no distinction between employer contributions in respect of the employee&#x2019;s own arrangement under the registered pension scheme and employer contributions for members of the employee&#x2019;s family or household&#x2019;s own arrangements for the purpose of the exemption given by Section 308 ITEPA.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM01570.htm#top)\n\n\n## Approved and registered personal pension schemes\n\nApproved or (from 6 April 2006) registered personal pension scheme arrangements made by an employee (or director) may provide for employer contributions as well as employee contributions. Where, under such arrangements, the employer pays **employer's **contributions the contributions are not chargeable on the employee as earnings of the employment (Section 308 ITEPA 2003).\n\nIf you find that the employer has paid contributions that the employee (or director) was supposed to make, without recovering the full amount from the employee, send a brief report to RISK team at SPT Pension Scheme Services in Nottingham. The report should include the following details:\n\n*   the name of the employee concerned\n*   the name and address of the employer\n*   the name of the pension provider\n*   the pension plan reference number.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM01570.htm#top)\n\n\n## Unapproved personal pension schemes and employer-financed retirement benefit schemes\n\nIf the employer contributes before 6 April 2006 to personal pension arrangements made by the employee which are not approved arrangements, the amount of the employer's contribution is chargeable on the employee as earnings of his employment (Section 224 ITEPA 2003).  Section 224 is repealed with effect from 6 April 2006.  There is no equivalent to that Section in connection with employer-financed retirement benefits schemes, so there can be no charge in respect of a contribution after 5 April 2006 to the extent that the contribution is not employment income provided through third parties (see [EIM45000](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45000.htm)).\n\nFor information about non-approved and employer-financed retirement benefit schemes see [EIM15010](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM15010.htm) onwards.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM01570.htm#top)\n\n\n## Payments from approved and registered pension schemes\n\nAs regards payments received by an employee out of an approved pension scheme, see [EIM74009](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM74009.htm) (for tax years before 2006/07) and for payments from a registered pension scheme see [EIM74014](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM74014.htm) (for tax years 2006/07 onwards)."}]},{"title":" Retirement lump sums","sections":[{"manual_section_id":"EIM04800","title":"Retirement lump sums: Section 637 ITEPA 2003 *","body":"Certain retirement lump sums are not chargeable as employment\nincome (see\n[EIM00510](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00510.htm)).

If the cost of an evening meal or breakfast is reimbursed on an actual basis, because it is included in the cost of an overnight stay, the employee would not also be entitled to the benchmark rate for breakfast or late evening meal.\n\n**Staying with friends and family rate** - A benchmark rate has not been set for a scale rate payment for staying with friends and family.  Furthermore, HMRC no longer accepts that a scale rate payment for this purpose should be agreed with an employer as part of a dispensation.  The travel rules still apply to actual costs of subsistence incurred while staying with friends and family.  The guidance at [EIM30073](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM30073.htm) has also been amended to reflect this revised view.

He qualifies for relief for travel expenses and therefore a scale rate payment because HMRC accepts that he travels in the performance of his duties. Both the Monday and Friday meetings are habitual and recur at fixed times. The breakfast and evening meal rates will not apply. He will still be entitled to the one meal or two meal rate.\n\n### Example 2\n\nA lorry driver whose normal working day is from 8.30 am to 5 pm is called upon occasionally by her employer to make extra deliveries in a day from a different depot meaning that she starts work at 7am (and leaves home before 6 am) and finishes after 8 pm. We would accept that the frequency of these extra duties is not regular. She will be entitled to the one or two meal rate and the breakfast or evening meal rate. She can not receive the benchmark scale rates for more than 3 meals in one 24 hour period.\n\n### Example 3\n\nA travelling engineer who normally works from 8.30 am to 5 pm is called upon once or twice a month to meet different customers in the evening. These meetings often finish after 8 pm. We would accept that the frequency of the meetings is not regular for these purposes. He will be entitled to the one or two meal rate and the evening meal rates on each occasion that he works after 8pm and incurs the cost of an additional qualifying meal."},{"manual_section_id":"EIM05233","title":"Advisory benchmark scale rates: questions and answers","body":"The following questions and answers were originally published in Revenue and Customs Bulletin 24/09 that has now been deleted.  They are addressed to the employer.  The answer to the first question was not intended to suggest that having notified HMRC of their intention to use the benchmark rates, employers could do so without agreement from HMRC.  You still need to consider the guidance at [EIM05230](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM05230.htm) onwards and [EIM30050](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM30050.htm) onwards.\n\n\n## Questions and answers\n\n### What you have to do if you want to pay benchmark scale rates to your employees?\n\nYou should apply to HMRC for a dispensation. You need to complete a form P11DX, which is the form used by employers to apply for a dispensation, and submit it to HMRC.  On the form you need to indicate with a tick against the appropriate statement under 'Travel and Subsistence' that you intend using HMRC&#x2019;s benchmark scale rates to reimburse your employees&#x2019; subsistence payments.  By ticking this box you would be merely notifying HMRC that you intend paying HMRC&#x2019;s benchmark scale rates for day subsistence and that you have adequate management processes in place to ensure that payments are only made where all the qualifying conditions are met.  If you want to apply to include other items of allowable expenditure in a dispensation for example fees and subscriptions, laundry, telephone charges, etc, you need to tick the appropriate boxes and supply the requested information on the form.\n\n### When can you pay a scale rate?\n\nScale rate payments may be made to employees who necessarily travel in the performance of their duties or have to travel to a temporary place of work.  The statutory rules are in Section 336 to 342 ITEPA 2003.  Where the employer agrees a scale rate in a dispensation, the scale rate may also be taken into account for NIC purposes.\n\nGuidance on how the employment income travel expense rules work can be found in HMRC&#x2019;s Booklet 490 Employee travel - A tax and NICs guide for employers.\n\n### When must you not pay tax and NICs free scale rates?\n\nTax and NICs free scale rates must not be paid where the employee is not travelling on a qualifying business journey. For example, when on a journey that involves ordinary commuting (or similar to ordinary commuting), or private travel.\n\nAdditionally, no tax and NICs free payment should be made if an employee does not incur an expense on meals after leaving home or his normal place of work, even if the journey was a qualifying business journey.  This means that employees who do not buy a meal or who take a packed lunch from home are not entitled to a tax and NICs free payment.\n\n### Do employers have to use the benchmark scale rates?\n\nEmployers do not have to use the benchmark rates.  They can reimburse their employees&#x2019; actual expenditure or apply to HMRC to agree a scale rate appropriate for their business needs in a dispensation.  However, where an employer wants to use a higher scale rate, it will have to undertake a sampling exercise to show the higher rates are in line with what its employees&#x2019; typically spend on subsistence and agree the rate with HMRC.\n\n### What records would an employer need to keep?\n\nAn employer will need to keep sufficient records to be able to demonstrate that the employee was entitled to the payment.  An employer also needs to be able to demonstrate that routine checks are undertaken to ensure that the travel expenses rules are being followed.\n\n### What happens to existing dispensations?\n\nExisting dispensations will remain in force until they come up for review in accordance with HMRC&#x2019;s rolling review programme, usually on a five year cycle.  When the existing dispensation comes up for review the employer can choose to switch to benchmark scale rates or apply to continue to use a tailored rate.  Where a new dispensation is requested the employer will have to go through the process of undertaking a statistically valid sampling exercise.\n\n### Uprating benchmark scale rates\n\nHMRC will review the rates annually and consider revising them when there has been a change in the scale rate of plus or minus 10 per cent based on the Consumer Price Index from when it was last revised.\n\n### How has HMRC arrived at the benchmark scale rates in question?\n\nHMRC reviewed the scale rates agreed for a number of employers, both large and small, and based the rates on the most commonly agreed rates.\n\nWhy not have higher benchmark rates for London or other locations where prices are more expensive?\n\nThe benchmark rates are linked to what employers typically reimburse their employees and it would not be possible to break this down between different locations.  Personal expenditure on subsistence varies significantly between employees even when working at the same location.\n\nIf an employer typically reimburses more than the benchmark rates then it will remain open to them to agree a higher rate with HMRC or to reimburse actual expenditure.

The tables cover a wide range of countries and regions and can be found in the HMRC internet library, Employment Income scale rates.\n\nWhat the tables contain\n\nFor most countries, there are benchmark rates for the larger cities as well as an &#x201C;elsewhere&#x201D; rate.  Employers wishing to use the published rates must ensure that they refer to the table entry for the city where the employee stayed, or the elsewhere rate, as appropriate.  Rates are quoted in the relevant foreign currency US$ or Euros.\n\nThe tables provide:\n\n*   a &#x201C;room rate&#x201D; per night\n*   a &#x201C;total residual rate&#x201D; and individual rates for breakfast where it is not included in the room rate, lunch, dinner etc.  The &#x201C;total residual rate&#x201D; figure is intended to cover the total cost of meals in a period of 24 hours, plus the cost of daily travel between the employee&#x2019;s hotel and office\n*   a &#x201C;24 hour rate&#x201D;.  This is the sum of the &#x201C;room rate&#x201D; and the &#x201C;total residual rate&#x201D;\n*   an &#x201C;over 10 hour rate&#x201D;, which is intended to cover subsistence expenses for any period of more than 10 but less than 24 hours\n*   an &#x201C;over 5 hour rate&#x201D;, which is intended to cover subsistence expenses for any period of more than 5 but less than 10 hours\n*   separate amounts for individual meals and other expenses incurred during the day.  Employers who wish to do so may use these rates instead of the &#x201C;over 5&#x201D;, &#x201C;over 10&#x201D; and &#x201C;24 hour&#x201D; rates (see [EIM05260](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM05260.htm)).\n\nWhilst most rates are published in the local currency, or are consistently in either US$ or Euro(&#x20AC;) , there are a number of countries where the room rate is published in either US$ or &#x20AC; and the total 5 hour, 10 hour and residual rates are in the local currency.  In these cases the 24 hour rate will show both currencies.\n\nFor some destinations, the table simply shows &#x201C;ACTUALS + &#xA3;4 PER DAY&#x201D;.  These are destinations for which no benchmark information is available.  In such cases, employers may reimburse their employees&#x2019; actual accommodation and subsistence expenses, plus &#xA3;4 per day to cover hotel-to-office travelling expenses.\n\nFor guidance on using the tables, see [EIM05260](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM05260.htm) and the examples at [EIM05280](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM05280.htm).\n\n### What is not covered\n\nThe benchmark rates are intended to represent the accommodation and subsistence expenses that employees incur during a period spent in a foreign country.  That is why the &#x201C;24 hour&#x201D;, &#x201C;over 10 hours&#x201D; and &#x201C;over 5 hours&#x201D; periods are measured by reference to the times of arrival at and departure from the foreign country (see [EIM05260](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM05260.htm)).  The benchmark rates do **not** cover incidental, allowable expenses that employees may incur en route - for example, the cost of a taxi to the airport in the UK, or necessary refreshments taken at the airport.  Employers who wish to use the benchmark rates may reimburse those other expenses separately, in addition to paying the benchmark rates.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual_section_id":"EIM05260","title":"Accommodation and subsistence payments to employees travelling outside the UK: tables of benchmark rates: how to use the benchmark rates","body":"Employers may use the individual meal rates or the hourly\nrates, but should not pay both for the same journey..\n\nSo, for employees who are away overnight, the employer may\ndecide to pay the &#x201C;24 hour&#x201D; rate for each complete\nperiod of 24 hours, starting from the time when the employee\narrives at the destination airport, or train station, and ending\nwhen they leave the country in question.\n\nAlternatively, the employer may prefer to pay the room rate\nplus individual amounts for the meals and other expenses that the\nemployee has incurred. Either method is acceptable, but employers\n\nshould not pay hourly rates and individual meal amounts for the\n\nsame journey.\n\nFor any period (or residual period) of less than 24 hours,\n\nthe employer may use\n\n*   the room rate (if the period includes an\n\n    overnight stay),\n    **plus**\n\n*   the over 5 hour rate or the over 10 hour\n\n    rate, as appropriate.\n\nThe over 5 hour rate applies to a period of more than 5 but less\n\nthan 10 hours.

Before considering whether the Section 776 (Section 331) exemption applies it will normally be necessary to consider whether the income is taxable in the first place.\n\nIf the sums concerned are taxable as earnings from an office or employment the &#x201C;scholarship income&#x201D; is likely to be chargeable to income tax on the holder. The concepts of &#x201C;earnings&#x201D; and &#x201C;scholarship income&#x201D; are mutually exclusive. However, if there is no office or employment then the income cannot be taxable as employment income. For example, student maintenance grants made available by grant awarding bodies  do not constitute taxable income. This is because no income tax liability arises on first principles, not because any such liability is exempted by Section 776 (Section 331). In order to tax the payments as employment income you must be able to demonstrate that the income was received in respect of an office or employment and not under a contract of training. Detailed guidance on offices, employments and contracts of training can be found in the Employment Status Manual (see ESM2505 onwards).\n\nIf there is neither an office nor an employment then a charge may arise under the Trading Income rules. For further guidance on any charge under the Trading Income rules see BIM65151.\n\nWhere the student comes from overseas the taxation position may be affected by a double taxation agreement. In such cases see DT1930.\n\nOnly if there is a taxable source do we need to consider whether the income is exempt from tax under Statement of Practice 4/86 (see [EIM06235](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM06235.htm)) or as a scholarship by virtue of Section 776 (Section 331) (see [EIM06205](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM06205.htm) onwards)."},{"manual_section_id":"EIM06215","title":"Scholarship income: directors and employees","body":"The general exemption in Section 776 IT(TOI)A 2005 (previously\nSection 331 ICTA 1988) that scholarship income shall be exempt from\nincome tax applies only to the scholarship holder (see\n[EIM06205](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM06205.htm) onwards).

The following conditions and exclusion apply.\n\n### Conditions\n\n1. The employer requires that the employee must be enrolled at the educational establishment for at least one academic year and must attend the course for at least twenty weeks in that academic year. Or if the course is longer the employee must attend for at least twenty weeks on average, in an academic year over the period of the course.\n\n2. The educational establishments must be recognised universities, technical colleges or similar educational establishments, which are open to members of the public generally and offer more than one course of practical or academic instruction. For example an employer&#x2019;s internal training school or one run by an employer&#x2019;s trade organisation will not satisfy the educational establishment condition for the Statement of Practice.\n\n3. For courses commencing on or after 1 September 2007, the payments, including lodging, subsistence and travelling allowances, but excluding any tuition fees payable by the employee to the university etc, do not exceed &#xA3;15,480 for the academic year.\n\n### Exclusion\n\n4. This exemption does not apply to payments of earnings made for any periods spent working for the employer during vacations or otherwise.\n\nIf the rate exceeds &#xA3;15,480 HMRC may look at the arrangements in detail. This is because the level of payment exceeds what might reasonably be described as a scholarship or training allowance. However, an increase in the rate of payment over the qualifying limit, part way through a course, will not affect the exemption applying to any payments for the earlier part of the course.\n\n[The limit for the academic years ending on 31 August 2006 and 31 August 2007 applied from 1 September 2005 and was set at &#xA3;15,000. For academic years ending on or before 31 August 2005 the limit was set at &#xA3;7,000 or an amount which a public awarding body such as a Research Council, would have granted to a student with similar personal circumstances.

For example, payments\n\nto disabled persons undergoing training in sheltered workshops are\n\ntreated as wages and subject to income tax.\n\nIt will normally be self-evident whether participants in\n\nthese schemes have employee or trainee status.\n\nEmployees will generally have a direct contract with the\n\nperson to whom they provide their services.\n\nTrainees will generally have a contract with the scheme\n\norganiser that may involve work experience or training involving a\n\nwork provider.

Land includes a house and most other forms of residential property, for example a flat.\n\n### Referral to Valuation Office Agency (VOA)\n\nIn all cases where land is transferred to a director or employee, an Inspector must consider whether the transfer is at full value and, if not, whether the undervalue is a profit from the directorship or employment. Where the property is in the United Kingdom the VOA  **must **be consulted (not on form CG20) in **all **cases where the transfer appears to be at less than full market value.\n\n**Failure to consult the VOA as soon as the information is available may result in the expiry of time limits before tax can be assessed on employment income.**&#xA0;\n\nIn Langham v Veltema, (STC3717), an SA return submitted by a director showed a house transferred to him for &#xA3;100,000. There was nothing on the return to indicate the basis for this valuation. The Inland Revenue should have consulted the District Valuer (DV), but it did not do so. Subsequently the company accounts were submitted showing the &#xA3;100,000 value on transfer of the property, and the Inland Revenue requested an opinion on the valuation from the DV. The DV agreed with the taxpayer a valuation of &#xA3;145,000.\n\nBy the date of agreement of the valuation the time limit had expired for the Inland Revenue to amend the taxpayer&#x2019;s SA return to include the full transfer value of &#xA3;145,000. A further assessment for &#xA3;45,000 was raised on the basis that the Inland Revenue could not have been expected from the information on the return to know the transfer took place at undervalue. The taxpayer appealed on the basis that the time limit for the Revenue to amend his self assessment had expired and there were no grounds for the issue of a &#x201C;discovery&#x201D; assessment since the transfer had been disclosed in the SA return.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, as the return had not alerted the Revenue to the possible insufficiency of the self assessment, so the Inspector could not have been reasonably expected to be aware of it, without consulting the DV.  Hence when the true value of the house came to light later, the Revenue was justified in issuing a &#x201C;discovery&#x201D; assessment.\n\nNonetheless if the DV had been consulted at the proper time it would have been apparent, before expiry of the relevant time limits for amending the self assessment, that the transfer took place at undervalue.   Consequently this case should serve as a reminder that when an asset is transferred between an employer and an employee, the DV must be consulted immediately for an opinion of the valuation provided.\n\nFor more information on consulting the  VOA see [EIM08002](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM08002.htm).

This is because of the need to obtain a defendable on appeal valuation report as part of the preparation for any appeal hearing at which the property valuation is one of the issues under appeal.\n\nThe first step is to establish the employee&#x2019;s grounds for disputing the position.\n\n### Employee agrees the valuation but disputes treatment of profit as earnings\n\nThis should be treated in the same way as any other dispute about how something should be dealt with under the employment income rules.

Any agreed valuation will be reported in due course by the VOA.\n\nIf agreement is not reached, the VOA will report that the position is unagreed, together with the reasons for the failure to reach agreement and the VOA&#x2019;s opinion of the value.  **Before** making an assessment, if it seems that no agreement on valuation is possible and that the matter will need to be resolved by formal means, ask the VOA to provide what is known as a &#x201C;defendable on appeal&#x201D; valuation report.  When you have received a defendable on appeal valuation report, a formal decision should be issued as appropriate.\n\nWhen submitting your request to the VOA, make it clear that you are requesting a report in connection with establishing liability as employment income. **(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**&#xA0;**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\nIf the decision is appealed, note that jurisdiction for hearing of the appeal lies with the First-tier Tribunal and not to the Lands Tribunal.  Although valuation of the land may be a major issue in the appeal, or perhaps the only issue if an employment income liability is agreed in principle, the subject of the appeal is a charge on employment income in the form of earnings or benefits.

He received reimbursements of travelling\n\nexpenses between his home (which was also the location of his GP\n\nsurgery) and the hospital. It was held that the reimbursements were\n\nnot &#x201C;earnings&#x201D; because his duties commenced as soon as\n\nhe received the emergency call. He had to give instructions for the\n\ncare of the patient until he arrived at the hospital. The inference\n\nwas that his duties were performed in two places - his home and the\n\nhospital. The journeys between the two places were linked so\n\nclosely to the performance of the duties at those places that they\n\ncould be regarded as actually made in the performance of those\n\nduties.\n\n Pook v Owen was an exceptional case. For example, if the\n\ndoctor was held up on the road, he had to ring the hospital and\n\nmake any resulting arrangements (see page 591 of 45TC).\n\n### action\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the\n\nFreedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\n*   **(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the\n\n    Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\n*   **(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the\n\n    Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\nAs regards emergency call-out to a place other than the normal\n\nplace of employment, see\n\n[EIM10050](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM10050.htm)."},{"manual_section_id":"EIM10050","title":"Travelling and subsistence payments: emergency call-out: travel between home and a place other than a normal place of employment","body":"A reimbursement of expenses incurred in travelling between an\nemployee's home and a place other than their normal place of\nemployment, as a result of an emergency call-out, is not taxable as\nearnings within Section 62 ITEPA 2003.\n\nBear in mind though that, unless the employee is in lower\npaid employment,\n**all** their expenses payments will be treated as\nearnings by Section 72, subject to any deduction under Section 336,\n337 or 338.
