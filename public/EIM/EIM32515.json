A request by an employee who is receiving dirty money for an additional expense deduction as a result should be considered on its merits. All of the conditions in Section 336 ITEPA 2003 must be met, see [EIM31630](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31600#EIM31630).\n\nIt does not necessarily follow that an employee who is receiving dirty money will have incurred any additional deductible expense as a result. For example, an employee who wears his or her own clothes to work is not permitted a deduction for the cost of washing those clothes simply because they may get unusually dirty, see [EIM32480](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32401#EIM32480).","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
