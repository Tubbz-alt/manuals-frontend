See\n[EIM74101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74101) for how to find the taxable\npension income for a tax year.\n\n### Registered pension schemes (2006-07 onwards)\n\nWith effect from 6 April 2006, most existing tax approved\npension arrangements became registered pension schemes. New schemes\nseeking the advantages available to registered pension schemes must\napply for registration. Section 579A ITEPA 2003 charges a pension\nunder a registered pension scheme. Section 579D provides that\npension under a registered scheme includes an annuity under, or\npurchased with sums or assets held for the purposes of, or\nrepresenting acquired rights under, a registered pension\nscheme.\n\n### Approved retirement benefits schemes (2005-06 and earlier)\n\nThese are frequently referred to as occupational pension schemes\n(see also\n[EIM74009](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74009)).

A retirement annuity contract means an\nannuity contract or trust scheme approved by HMRC under Section 620\nor Section 621 ICTA 1988. It includes a substituted contract within\nthe meaning of Section 622(3) ICTA 1988.\n\nAlthough it has not been possible to enter into new contracts\nsince 1988, these contracts remain an important source of\nretirement income for the self employed.

The exemption also\napplies to an allowance paid in lieu of such provision. The amount\nof coal or fuel provided or the allowance paid in respect of coal\nor fuel must not substantially exceed the amount reasonably\nrequired for personal use. A former colliery worker is defined as\nany person who has ceased to be employed as a coal miner or who has\nceased to be employed at a colliery. Those who were employed in\nclerical, administrative or technical work are excluded from the\ndefinition and therefore cannot obtain the exemption.\n\nBefore 6 April 2003, this exemption was given by extending\nthe application of an Extra-Statutory Concession (ESC A6) to\nretired miners (see SE66695).\n\n### Exemptions for non residents\n\nPart 9 Chapter 18 ITEPA 2003 exempts certain pensions that are\npayable to persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom.

Income may be taken in the form of an annuity or\nby means of an income withdrawal under arrangements made in\naccordance with the scheme. Section 595 ITEPA 2003 charges\nannuities acquired using funds held for the purposes of an approved\npersonal pension scheme (see\n[EIM74007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74007)).

It does not apply to payments\nrepresenting the return of surplus employee additional voluntary\ncontributions (see\n[EIM74013](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74013)). Section 593 ITEPA 2003\napplies Section 583 to similar payments from former approved\nsuperannuation funds. A similar provision in Section 601 ITEPA 2003\ncharges unauthorised personal pension payments.\n\nSection 583 applies where the unauthorised payment is made to\nor for the benefit of an employee or an ex-spouse or former civil\npartner of an employee and it is that person who will be liable for\ntax.

For 2006-07 onwards, the\nexemption is\n**not** available for pensions (including annuities)\nunder registered pension schemes chargeable under Section 579A\nITEPA 2003, see\n[EIM74014](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74014).\n\n The exempt amount is determined in accordance with the\nfollowing steps.\n\n*   **Step 1** - determine the pension that would have\nbeen payable had the person ceased to hold the employment or office\nbecause of the disablement but the disablement had not been\nattributable to the performance of the duties of the employment or\noffice or to war injuries.\n*   **Step 2**\n\n*   If no pension would have been payable under step\n1, then the whole of the disablement pension is exempt.\n*   If a pension of a smaller amount would have been\npayable, the exempt amount is the amount by which the disablement\npension exceeds the smaller amount.\n*   In all other cases, the exempt amount is nil.\n\n### Example 1\n\nAn employee is injured in an explosion at work. There is no\npension entitlement under the employer's registered pension scheme.\nHowever, the employer offers a pension of &#xA3;20,000 per year as\nthe employee is unable to work as a result of the injuries suffered\nin the blast. Section 644 exempts all of the &#xA3;20,000 from\ntax.\n\n### Example 2\n\nAnother employee is injured in the same explosion. He is a\nmember of the staff pension scheme operated by the employer. He is\noffered early retirement on ill-health grounds as he is unable to\nwork in consequence of injuries suffered in the explosion. Section\n644 cannot apply to this pension because it is chargeable under\nSection 579A ITEPA 2003 (registered pension schemes). It is all\ntaxable.\n\n### Example 3\n\nA third employee is also injured in the explosion. She takes\nearly retirement on ill-health grounds and receives a pension from\nthe staff pension scheme. The pension is quite small so the\nemployer decides to pay an additional sum of &#xA3;10,000 per year\nin consequence of injuries suffered. The pension from the\nregistered pension scheme is taxable under Section 579A ITEPA 2003.\nThe additional pension from the employer of &#xA3;10,000 is\nchargeable under Section 569 ITEPA 2003 (UK pensions) and is exempt\nunder Section 644.\n\n### Comment\n\nSection 644 is unlikely to exempt a pension paid to an employee\nwho takes early retirement on ill- health grounds as the same\npension could be awarded in consequence of illness or disability\nunrelated to work. The exemption only covers a pension or part\npension arising wholly from work-related disability or illness.\n\n The exemption does not apply in the case of a dependant's\npension paid on the death of a person whose pension qualified for\nthe exemption. This is because the dependant's pension is payable\nbecause of the person's death and not because a person has ceased\nto hold an employment due to disablement attributable to the\nperformance of the duties of the employment."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM74013","title":"Return of surplus employee additional voluntary contributions (2005-06 and earlier)","body":"**Note: with effect from 6 April 2006, most existing tax\napproved pension arrangements became registered pension schemes.\nSection 623 has been repealed and does not apply to 2006-07 and\nlater years.**\n\nMembers of retirement benefits schemes can boost the pensions\nthey will receive by making additional voluntary contributions\n(AVCs).

These changes came into effect on 6 April 2006.  Most pension arrangements approved under the previous regime became registered pension schemes on 6 April 2006.  These include approved retirement benefit schemes, former approved superannuation funds, approved personal pension schemes and retirement annuity contracts.  New schemes seeking the advantages available to registered pension schemes must apply for registration.\n\nThe Registered Pension Schemes manual provides detailed guidance about registered pension schemes including tax relief, allowances, member benefits and unauthorised payments.\n\n### Taxation of pensions under registered schemes\n\nFrom 6 April 2006, all pensions and annuities paid under registered pension schemes are taxable under the rules in Part 9 Chapter 5A ITEPA 2003.  Section 579A ITEPA 2003 charges a pension under a registered pension scheme.  Section 579D ITEPA 2003 provides that a pension under a registered scheme includes an annuity under, or purchased with sums or assets held for the purposes of, or representing acquired rights under, a registered pension scheme.  The definition of pension in Section 579D also includes income withdrawals.  See [EIM74101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74101) for how to find the taxable pension income for a tax year.\n\n### Treatment of lump sums\n\nChapter 15A ITEPA 2003 makes provision about exemptions and charges in relation to lump sums under registered pensions schemes.  Section 636A ITEPA 2003 provides that no liability to income tax arises on specified lump sums.\n\nSome lump sums are taxed as pensions.  These are trivial commutation lump sums and winding-up lump sums (Section 636B ITEPA 2003) and lump sum death benefits payable on trivial commutation or winding up (Section 636C ITEPA 2003).\n\n### The Pension Protection Fund\n\nThe Pension Protection Fund is a statutory fund established under the Pensions Act 2004 and became operational on 6 April 2005.  It pays compensation to members of certain pension schemes where employer insolvency means that there are insufficient assets in the pension scheme to cover specified levels of compensation.\n\nThe Pension Protection Fund not a registered pension scheme.

If\nthe contribution record is unsatisfactory either a reduced rate or\nno pension at all will be payable.\n2.  **Additional pension** - this is the earnings-related\npart of a retirement pension.

This will include a comparison between the\namount the person will receive if that person chooses the enhanced\nweekly state pension and the amount payable as a lump sum together\nwith the weekly state pension paid at the standard rate.\n\nOnce the claim for the state pension takes effect, the person\nhas a limited time (prescribed by the DWP) to choose between the\nenhanced weekly state pension and the lump sum. If the person does\nnot notify the DWP of their choice within that time, the person\nwill be paid the lump sum.\n\n### Later year election\n\nWhen a person chooses to receive the state pension lump sum,\nthen that person may elect to receive the lump sum payment in the\ntax year immediately following the tax year in which the claim for\n\npayment of the weekly state pension takes effect. Once again, the\n\nperson has a limited time (prescribed by the DWP) to make the\n\nelection. This will affect the tax year for which the state pension\n\nlump sum is assessable (see\n\n[EIM74653](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74653)).\n\nWhere an election is made, the earliest date that DWP may\n\nmake payment of the lump sum will be 6 April of the later tax year.\n\nNevertheless, a person might choose the later year if they\n\nanticipate that their marginal rate (see\n\n[EIM74652](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74652)) in the year in which the claim\n\nfor payment of the weekly state pension takes effect will be\n\ngreater than it will be in the following year.\n\nFor example, the person may have deferred claiming the state\n\npension whilst working beyond the state pension age. Consequently,\n\nthe level of income in the tax year in which they retire and claim\n\nthe weekly state pension might be greater than that for the\n\nfollowing year. In that instance, it might be advantageous to\n\nreceive payment of the state pension lump sum in the year following\n\nthe year of retirement.\n\n### Requests for advice\n\nYou may receive requests from pensioners for assistance in\n\nworking out their likely marginal rate, in order to help them to\n\nmake this decision.\n\nWhen you give advice about the marginal rate, you must stress\n\nthat\n\n*   you can only provide assistance on the\n\n    basis of the information given to you\n*   that any guidance you can give will only\n\n    be provisional\n*   the actual amount of income received in a\n\n    year &#x2013; and the rate at which that income is taxable &#x2013;\n\n    cannot be finalised until after the end of the tax year.\n\nYou must take care\n\n*   **not** to advise taxpayers specifically in which year\n\n    they should claim the lump sum payment, and\n*   restrict your advice to helping to\n\n    calculate the marginal rate of tax."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM74660","title":"Social security pension lump sum: taxing the lump sum","body":"Because of the potential size of any state pension lump it is\nnot feasible to restrict a PAYE tax coding to collect any tax due\non a lump sum. The state pension lump sum is therefore treated as\nPAYE income and the Department for Work and Pensions (Pensions\nService) will operate a simplified form of PAYE. An individual, at\nthe time of finalising their state pension lump sum, will be asked\nby DWP to make an initial self-declaration of their highest (or\nmarginal) rate of tax.\n\nTax based on this self-declaration will then be withheld by\nDWP when making payment of the lump sum. This self-declaration will\nmean for most recipients of a state pension lump sum the correct\nrate of tax has been applied at the time of payment. If the\nindividual fails to make a self- declaration of their highest rate\nof tax, tax at the basic rate will automatically be withheld by\nDWP.\n\nAt the end of each tax year DWP will notify HMRC of all state\npension lump sums paid, together with details of the tax withheld\n\nbased on the claimants&#x2019; self-declarations.
