{"title":"Termination payments and benefits: Section 401 ITEPA 2003: threshold, exceptions, reliefs and reduction","details":{"manual_section_id":"EIM13500","body":"\n\n## Sections 402 and 405 to 414 ITEPA 2003\n\nFor the purposes of Section 401 ITEPA 2003 there is a threshold (currently &#xA3;30,000) below which payments and benefits do not count as employment income (see [EIM00510](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00510.htm)).\n\nThere are also exceptions, reliefs and a reduction for payments and benefits chargeable under that Section as well as some payments which are defined as not being &#x201C;benefits&#x201D;. These are set out in the table below.\n\nThe **reduction **relates to foreign service (see [EIM13700](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13700.htm)) and must be claimed within four years after the end of the year of assessment to which it relates (for claims made before 2 April 2010 the limit is five years from 31 January following the year of assessment). All the exceptions are given without a claim if the conditions are satisfied.\n\nIt is important to make sure that all Section 401 ITEPA 2003 charges in respect of an employment are added together before the threshold is applied. For example:\n\n*   a charge on the provision of assets (see [EIM13020](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13020.htm)) must be added to any cash payment for that termination before the threshold is applied*   payments and benefits must be aggregated in some circumstances (seeEIM13530).\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Threshold, exception, relief or reduction etc\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n### Notes\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n### Guidance\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n&#xA3;30,000\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nGeneral threshold for charges within Section 401 ITEPA 2003.\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13505](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13505.htm) to EIM13550\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nDeath\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nException for payment or benefit given when employment is terminated by employee&#x2019;s death\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13600](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13600.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nInjury and disability\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nException where payment or benefit given on account of physical injury to, or disability of, an employee\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13610](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13610.htm) to EIM13650\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nLump sum from retirement benefit scheme Does not exempt lump sum from a non-approved scheme\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nDoes not exempt a lump sum from a non-approved or, from 6 April 2006, an employer-financed scheme (see [EIM15000](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM15000.htm) onwards)\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13660](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13660.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nLump sum from overseas retirement benefit scheme\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nExtra-Statutory Concession A10\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13670](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13670.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nIndemnity insurance\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13675](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13675.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nBenefit from an overseas territory\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13710](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13710.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nH M Forces payment\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13720](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13720.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nDouble taxation\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13730](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13730.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nContribution to approved retirement benefits scheme\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nIncludes a registered scheme from 6 April 2006\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13735](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13735.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nPayment to meet legal costs connected with termination\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nExtra-Statutory Concession A81\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13740](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13740.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nOutplacement counselling\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13745](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13745.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nAdditional lump sum compensation payment\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nPayable to civil servants and ex-civil servants with retained rights from 1987\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13747](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13747.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nForeign service\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nA full exception: if the conditions are not met, a foreign service reduction may still be due, see next entry below\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13680](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13680.htm) to EIM13690\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nForeign service reduction\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nReduces the amount of the payment that is chargeable\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n[EIM13700](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13700.htm)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nBenefits connected with:\n\n*   taxable cars and vans and HGVs\n*   mobile phones\n*   computer equipment\n\n**Note**: for each of these benefits, assume that it is received for duties of the employment when applying the guidance\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nExempts these benefits when given as part of a termination package.
