This works by exception: every mechanically propelled road vehicle is a &#x201C;car&#x201D; unless it is\n\n*   (i) a goods vehicle (a vehicle of a construction primarily suited for the conveyance of goods or burden of any description),\n*   (ii) a motor cycle (as defined in Section 185 Road Traffic Act 1988),*   (iii) an invalid carriage (also as defined in that Act), or\n*   (iv) a vehicle of a type not commonly used as a private vehicle and unsuitable to be so used.\n\n### Exceptions (2) and (3)\n\nIt is normally obvious whether either applies.\n\n### Exception (4)\n\nThis exception can also be discounted in most cases.  Irrespective of their use in practice, there is nothing that renders most vehicles inherently unsuitable for private use.  Indeed the marketing of many whose status might otherwise be uncertain is aimed at illustrating how well fitted they are for private use.\n\nIt follows that, if a vehicle is to escape from being classified as a car, it will normally need to satisfy the first of the tests in Section 115(1).\n\n### Exception (1)\n\nThis looks at the construction of a vehicle to see if it is primarily suited for the conveyance of goods or burden (note that &#x2018;primarily&#x2019; is crucial and that &#x2018;goods or burden&#x2019; does not include people).  This means we must look to see if there is a predominant purpose of construction.\n\nActual use of a particular vehicle is irrelevant: the statutory test is a test of construction, not use.\n\nThe fact that the manufacturer or dealer describes the vehicle as a &#x201C;commercial vehicle&#x201D; is not conclusive.\n\nIf a vehicle is designed and marketed as a multi-purpose vehicle, it is unlikely to fall within this exception.\n\nEven if the preceding 2 paragraphs do not apply but neither purpose predominates with regard to the construction of the vehicle, the vehicle is not primarily suited for either purpose and this means that it does not escape from being a car.  Clearly if its primary purpose is to carry passengers it will also remain within the company car legislation (unless it is so big that it is clearly a bus).  It is only if the primary purpose for which the vehicle is constructed is the carriage of goods that it will escape from being a car.\n\nIf a vehicle has side windows behind the driver and passenger doors, it is also unlikely to fall within this exception.  This is particularly so if it is fitted, or is capable of being fitted, with additional seating behind the row which includes the driver.  This remains true whether or not those additional seats are in the vehicle at the time.\n\nThere is guidance on the specific type of vehicle known as double cab pick-ups at [EIM23150](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23150), on other off-road vehicles at [EIM23145](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23145) and on other specific types of vehicle at [EIM23155](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23155)**.**&#xA0;\n\nWhere a vehicle does escape being a car because exception 1 applies, the van benefit rules of Section 154 ITEPA will normally apply ([EIM22700](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22700) for 2005/06 onwards, [EIM22050](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22050) for years to 2004/05).  Otherwise, unless the specific rules for heavy goods vehicles prevent a charge ([EIM22990](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22700#EIM22990)), the residual benefit rules of Section 201 ITEPA onwards will apply ([EIM20000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20000)).\n\nIt is worth noting that Vehicle Excise Duty and VAT legislation are both different to tax legislation, so the same vehicle can be treated differently by the different agencies.  For instance, VED is based on type approval at the time the vehicle is first registered, whereas VAT and the tax/NICs regimes consider the nature of the vehicle at the time of the transaction or in the relevant tax year."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23115","title":"Car benefit: vehicle of a construction primarily suited for the conveyance of goods or burden of any description: meaning of construction"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23120","title":"Car benefit: vehicle of a construction primarily suited for the conveyance of goods or burden of any description: meaning of primarily suited","body":"\n\n## Section 115 ITEPA 2003\n\nThe guidance on this page explains how to apply the second part of the test described at [EIM23115](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23115), that is whether the construction of the vehicle is primarily suited for the conveyance of goods or burden of any description.\n\nThe importance of the word primarily is that it:\n\n*   recognises that a vehicle may be suited to fulfil more than one purpose and\n*   makes it clear that a vehicle will only fall outside the definition of car in this context if it has a predominant purpose of carrying goods or burden.\n\nMost estate cars (or indeed cars with some sort of boot) are suited to the dual purpose of carrying passengers and some cargo or luggage.

Those cases show that a vehicle that has been modified in some way can be a different type from one that has not been modified.  It does not matter that they are both of the same basic model.

The Court accepted that this made it a type of vehicle not commonly used as a private vehicle (see [EIM23125](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23125)).\n\nIt was also unsuitable to be used as a private vehicle because the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations make it illegal for members of the public to use on the road a vehicle with a fixed flashing light. There are similar restrictions within the Road Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations governing the type of vehicles that can carry two-tone horns and sirens.\n\nVehicles can only be fitted with flashing blue lights and audible warning devices such as sirens if they are emergency vehicles. Emergency vehicles are defined in the regulations to include vehicles used for fire brigade, ambulance or police purposes.\n\nWhere a vehicle that would otherwise be treated as a car for car benefit purpose is an emergency vehicle because it has blue flashing lights and/or audible warning devices, you can accept that it is of a type not commonly used as a private vehicle and unsuitable to be so used. The car benefit charge will not then apply. However, if the vehicle is also used for private purposes, there will be a residual liability to charge under Section 203 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM21630](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21601#EIM21630) onwards) unless the specific exemption below applies.\n\nIn other cases, the fact that a car has been modified in some way will not make it either illegal or unsuitable for use as a private vehicle. In particular, the fact that a car is usually kept loaded with goods or equipment does not mean that it is unsuitable for use as a private vehicle if all that is necessary to make it suitable is to unload the items in question.\n\n### Specific exemption from 2004/05 in specified circumstances\n\nCertain emergency vehicles are exempt from tax from 2004/05 if the specified conditions concerning the vehicle, the employee and the use of the vehicle are all met.  See [EIM23600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23600) for full details."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23145","title":"Car benefit: off road and multi-purpose vehicles","body":"\n\n## Section 115(1) ITEPA 2003\n\nLuxury off road vehicles, four wheel drive recreational vehicles and multi-purpose vehicles will usually count as cars.

However, when all factors relating to their construction are taken into account, a number of vehicles within this category do have a predominant purpose of carrying goods or burden.\n\nIt follows from the above that it is not possible on first principles to come up with a single categorisation for all double cab pick-ups. Nor is it possible to give a blanket ruling on any particular makes, as the standard vehicle may have been adapted in the factory, by the dealer, or once acquired. So each case will depend on the facts and the exact specification during the period when the vehicle is made available for private use.\n\n### Interpretation of the legislation (originally an interim measure for 2002/03 onwards)\n\nFrom 2002/03, when deciding whether double cab pick-ups count as cars or vans, HMRC will interpret the legislation that defines car and van for tax purposes in line with the definitions used for VAT purposes. The position in respect of earlier tax years remains unchanged.\n\nUnder this measure, a double cab pick-up that has a payload of 1 tonne (1,000kg) or more is accepted as a van for benefits purposes. Payload means gross vehicle weight (or design weight) less unoccupied kerb weight (care is needed when looking at manufacturers&#x2019; brochures as they sometimes define payload differently).\n\nUnder a separate agreement between Customs and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a hard top consisting of metal, fibre glass or similar material, with or without windows, is accorded a generic weight of 45kg. Therefore the addition of a hard top to a double cab pick-up with an ex-works payload of 1,010 kg will convert the vehicle into a car (net payload reduced to 965 kg).  Under this agreement, the weight of all other optional accessories is disregarded.  HMRC has also adopted this treatment.\n\nCustoms has been in discussions with the major manufacturers as to which of their models will no longer be regarded as cars. Potential purchasers can obtain advice about the payload of a particular model from the manufacturer or dealer. If they request any more information, you should refer them to this page on the HMRC website (full address: www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM23150.htm).\n\nYou should not comment on how a particular vehicle will be treated. You should ensure that enquirers know that the website contains the latest information on the criteria used and that any changes or developments will be publicised there.\n\nIn case of difficulty see [EIM23160](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23160).\n\n### Other vehicles\n\nThe 1 tonne rule only applies to double cab pick-ups, not to any other vehicle.\n\nOther specific types of vehicle are dealt with at [EIM23155](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23155)."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23155","title":"Car benefit: other specific types of vehicle","body":"\n\n## Section 115(1) ITEPA 2003\n\n### Motor homes\n\nHMRC has always considered these vehicles to be cars for tax purposes because\n\n*   they are mechanically propelled road vehicles, and\n*   none of the exceptions in s115(1) ([EIM23100](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23100)) apply to prevent them being cars.\n\nIn March 2006, the High Court confirmed an earlier decision by the Special Commissioners and upheld this view in the cases of County Pharmacy Ltd v HMRC and D A H Morris v HMRC, Mr Morris being managing director of the company.\n\nUntil the judgement is published in the Tax Cases series, it can be found at:\n\n*   All England Law Reports, [2006] EWHC 1560 (Ch)\n*   Simon&#x2019;s Tax Cases, [2006] STC 1593.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\n### Land Rover Defender Station Wagons\n\nHMRC has always considered these vehicles to be cars for tax purposes for the reasons given above, i.e. that\n\n*   they are mechanically propelled road vehicles, and\n*   none of the exceptions in s115(1) ([EIM23100](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23100)) apply to prevent them being cars."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23160","title":"Car benefit: meaning of car: submissions to PAYE Technical","body":"\n\n## Section 115(1) ITEPA 2003\n\nMake a report to Employment Income Technical:\n\n*   before you accept a claim that any outwardly conventional car should not be regarded as a car for the purpose of the car and car fuel scale charges\n*   in any other case of doubt or difficulty, but in particular when you anticipate that a taxpayer may appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\nBefore contacting Employment Income Technical, please ensure that you have full details of:\n\n*   the vehicle\n*   the model*   if it is a double cab pick-up and you are still unsure about its status after reading [EIM23150](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23150), its gross vehicle weight/design weight and its unoccupied kerb weight\n*   details of any changes to the standard specification."}]},{"title":" The car must be made available without any transfer of the property in it","sections":[{"manual-section-id":"EIM23200","title":"Car benefit: meaning of made available","body":"\n\n## Section 114(1) ITEPA 2003\n\nCar benefit can only apply when the car is &#x201C;made available&#x201D;.

He was required to be on call at any time and was provided with a company car. He used this to travel between his home and the company's nearby business premises and for genuine business trips. He successfully argued before the Commissioners that:\n\n*   he was prohibited from using the car privately\n*   he never used the car for private motoring.\n\nIn consequence, the twin tests imposed by Section 118(1) ITEPA 2003 were met so that no car benefit charge arose.\n\nVinelott J in the High Court saw no grounds for reversing the Commissioners' decision because of the very special facts as found by them, the essence of which was that:\n\n*   his work base was his home and not his employer's premises\n*   all journeys made by the taxpayer, including those between his home and the company's premises, were therefore business travel and\n*   in this particular context, where the taxpayer was in essence an ordinary, but senior and trusted employee of the company (he was a director, but had no material interest in the company), the verbal prohibition made by the company's managing director on the private use of the car was valid and enforceable.\n\nAlthough the decision in this case turned upon the particular facts, it still provides judicial guidance on the factors that need to be present in order to be satisfied that the terms on which the car is made available prohibit private use.\n\nThe key principles that emerge from the case are:\n\n*   there must be an **express **ban on private use, that is the ban must be explicitly stated, so that an implied ban is insufficient to meet the test\n*   there must be a legally **enforceable **ban on private use.\n\nProvided these factors are present, and depending on the context in which it is delivered, a verbal prohibition may count as an effective and meaningful ban on private use.\n\n### The requirement that there is no actual private use of the car\n\nThere are two parts to the test at [EIM23400](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23400), both of which must be satisfied.

The cars or vans are not allocated to any one employee and are only available for genuine business use. Such cars and vans are usually known as pooled cars and vans.\n\nSections 167 and 168 ITEPA 2003 ensure that no car or van benefit arises on a pooled car or van made available by reason of the employment that, in the relevant tax year, satisfies **all **the following conditions:\n\n1.  it was made available to, and actually used by, more than one of those employees\n2.  it was made available, in the case of each of those employees, by reason of the employee's employment\n3.  it was not ordinarily used by one of those employees to the exclusion of the others\n4.  in the case of each of those employees, any private use of it made by the employee was merely incidental to the employee's other use of it in that year (see [EIM23455](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23455)), and\n5.  it was not normally kept overnight on or in the vicinity of any residential premises where any of the employees was residing, except while being kept overnight on premises occupied by the person making it available to them (see [EIM23465](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23465)).\n\nFor the purpose of these five conditions all employees should be considered, including those in excluded employments, who would not be chargeable to tax even if the car or van were available for their private use.\n\nThe conditions to be met are essentially questions of fact. Each of them has to be considered in turn. It is not enough that a car satisfies any four of them and narrowly fails the fifth. It must satisfy all five conditions. All the relevant facts should be obtained, preferably by way of interview, before a decision is taken.\n\nFor the meaning of private use and business travel see [EIM23305](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23305).\n\nAn Inspector should consider any claim that a car or van is a pooled car or van if you are in doubt. If doubts persists, see [EIM23470](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23470).\n\nAs regards vans that are not pooled vans see [EIM22700](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22700) onwards for years from 2005/06 and [EIM22050](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22050) for earlier years.\n\nAs regards the apportionment of the car benefit and car fuel scale charges in cases where pool car status does not apply, see [EIM25200](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24000#EIM25200)."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23455","title":"Pooled cars and vans: meaning of private use merely incidental to business use","body":"\n\n## Sections 167(3)(d) and 168(3)(d) ITEPA 2003\n\nThe meaning of the phrase merely incidental to may give rise to difficulty.\n\nWe regard it as implying a qualitative rather than a quantitative test. It does not refer to the extent of private mileage but rather to the private element viewed in the context of a journey as a whole. Support for this view can be found in Robson v Dixon (48TC527) where the judge said in another context that\n\n\"the words \"merely incidental to\" are ... apt to denote an activity ... which does not serve any independent purpose but is carried out in order further some other purpose\".\n\nThus the use of a car or van for what is primarily a business journey, but which includes some limited private use, would satisfy the words merely incidental to.\n\nAn example might be an employee who is required to make a long business journey. So that the employee can make an early morning start he or she is allowed to take a pooled car home the previous evening.  Considered in isolation, the office to home journey is private use, but in these circumstances it is plainly subordinate to the business journey the next day. It is undertaken to facilitate the business trip. It is thus merely incidental to the business use.\n\nEven so, a reservation is necessary in this type of case. If it happened too often the car would fail condition (e) at [EIM23450](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23450) because it would be kept fairly often in the vicinity of the employee's home (see [EIM23465](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23465)).

Private use that is not merely incidental to business use should in practice be ignored in deciding whether the vehicle comes under the protection of either Section 167 ITEPA 2003 (cars) or Section 168 ITEPA 2003 (vans) where such private use is:\n\n*   small in extent and infrequent and\n*   consists of either or both of:\n\n*   *   use limited to meeting the immediate need for transport in an emergency where the use of the vehicle is provided on compassionate grounds\n    *   use for the purposes of the provision of another benefit that does not itself give rise to a tax charge where the use of the vehicle is merely incidental to the provision of that other benefit.\n\nSmall in extent and infrequent will generally be not more than 5% of the vehicle's annual mileage on occasions that are neither regular nor protracted.\n\nUse meeting the immediate need for transport in an emergency where the use of the vehicle is provided on compassionate grounds covers the kind of case where an employee is taken ill at work, or learns at work that a member of his or her family has been involved in an accident. It does not apply where an employee's normal vehicle breaks down and the pool vehicle is used as a substitute.\n\nUse for the purposes of the provision of another benefit that does not itself give rise to a tax charge where the use of the vehicle is merely incidental to the provision of that other benefit might apply in a number of different situations. One example would be the use of a pool vehicle to take employee-provided equipment, such as a table tennis table, to an employer-provided sports facility.

This will need supporting evidence (a mere belief or assertion is insufficient).  In the absence of such evidence, condition B is not met.  This view was supported by the First-Tier Tribunal in the case of S Barnard Ltd v HMRC, TC00491.\n\n### Note 2: equivalent car\n\nThis means equivalent in terms of size, status, age, list price (but not necessarily the same model). The fact that a car that is not equivalent is made available is irrelevant: if the taxpayer cannot establish that an equivalent car is made available, condition B is not met.\n\n### Note 3: normal commercial practice\n\nIt is often argued that this condition is satisfied because:\n\n*   it suits the business aims of the employer for this employee to have a car, or\n*   the employee's cash salary is set at a level that is low in relation to the duties performed. Therefore the overall remuneration package of cash salary plus a car is set at a commercial level and reflects the value of the duties performed by the employee.\n\nNeither of these arguments on their own will succeed in demonstrating that condition B is satisfied.\n\nThis condition is not directed at ascertaining whether or not the overall remuneration package was set at a commercial level or whether it was in some way commercially convenient for the employer to ensure that the employee in question was provided with a company car.\n\nInstead, the test quite specifically tells us to focus on the making available of the car alone. Is it the case that the making available of an equivalent car is in accordance with the normal commercial practice for an employment of the kind held by M?  This will require hard evidence of other employers who actually provide equivalent cars to employees in an employment of the kind held by M.\n\n### Note 4: employment of the kind held by M\n\nThis means in similar employment with a different employer (if the comparison is with other employees of the same employer, see condition A at [EIM23565](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23565)). Duties, hours of work and level of remuneration need to be similar in order for this condition to be satisfied.\n\nSometimes it is argued that it is highly significant that the member of the relevant employee's family or household holds the position of company secretary. But unless the employer is a large company, usually this involves little more than relatively routine administrative duties. If the employer is a relatively small company, the post is not in any way analogous to the same position as the company secretary of a large concern, where it would possibly be more usual for a car to be provided.\n\n### Effect of the section\n\nIf the primary condition (see [EIM23560](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23560)) and condition B are both met, E is not chargeable for the benefit of the car for that tax year.\n\nIf the primary condition (see [EIM23560](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23560)) is met but condition B is not, consider condition A ([EIM23565](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23565)).\n\n### Application to vans\n\nThis guidance applies equally to van benefit"}]},{"title":" Emergency vehicles (this section of the guidance also applies to van benefit)","sections":[{"manual-section-id":"EIM23600","title":"Emergency vehicles exemption from 2004/05: conditions 1-3","body":"\n\n## Section 248A ITEPA 2003\n\nThis section was introduced in Finance Act 2004 and has effect from 2004/05.

The decision in Pepper v Hart (65TC421) on marginal cost does not apply in these cases. However, particular problems arise in the motor industry in connection with demonstration, test and experimental cars.\n\nWhere, as part of the normal duties, a director, car salesperson or demonstrator takes a car home for the express purpose of calling on a prospective customer, do not on that account alone treat the car as available for private use. In essence, the whole journey is for a genuine business purpose. If, however, such a car is otherwise available for the employee's private use, for example, at weekends or holidays, the appropriate car benefit will be chargeable.\n\nThe use for testing purposes of experimental/developmental cars by engineers in both the motor and motor components industries should be looked at in the light of all the facts. Generally speaking, it is unlikely that a tax charge will arise. If, however, you find that such a car is used privately, the appropriate car benefit will be chargeable.\n\nYou will find below an extract from a circular dated 28 September 1976 and issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) to its members and to which the then Board of Inland Revenue offered no objection. You can regard this extract as amplifying the second and third subparagraphs of this instruction above.\n\n### Extract from the circular\n\n\"**Use of company-owned cars within the motor industry**&#xA0;\n\n**i) Demonstration cars**\n\nThe Revenue do not consider that the fact that a car is the tool of trade for the car salesman is sufficient reason for introducing special arrangements.\n\n**ii) Frequent changes in the cars allocated to employees**\n\nIt is common practice, both in the motor manufacturing industry and the retail motor industry, for cars available to employees to be changed frequently for sales promotion reasons. This could lead to problems in determining the correct charge to tax as individual cars are likely to fall into different taxable benefit categories. The Revenue recognises the need for administrative simplicity and the need to avoid both the Revenue and companies becoming involved in detailed records for each car. In such cases local Inspectors will be permitted to agree with companies an appropriate mean charge to benefit.\n\n**iii) Test and experimental cars**\n\nTest engineers in both the motor industry and the components industry are often required, as part of their jobs, to test cars under various driving conditions. For certain types of test such as cold starting, the only practical way of conducting them is for the engineers concerned to use the cars for private journeys and to report on their performance. In almost all cases the employees concerned have another company-owned car allocated to them on a permanent basis.\n\nNo general ruling can be made in such cases as the employee's tax position would depend on the facts of individual cases. It is clear, however, that in cases where the employees concerned have the use of a company-owned car on a permanent basis, the occasional use of a test car for private journeys would not give rise to an additional charge to tax. Inland Revenue would, however, look closely at the use made of test cars and are unlikely to take a sympathetic view in cases where, for example, test cars are used for an employee's holiday travel.\"\n\n### 2009/10 and later years\n\nSee [EIM23800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23800) onwards."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23755","title":"Employees in the motor industry (to 2008/09): frequent changes of car: calculating the car benefit charge","body":"The system for charging car benefits based on price and CO2 emissions could mean a considerable amount of record keeping and administrative work where there are **very **frequent changes of cars. HMRC staff can take measures locally to accommodate these administrative difficulties within the terms of the car benefit legislation. The measures are applied solely for the purpose of simplifying the calculation of the amount of the car benefit charge and **are not intended to result in a lower tax charge for the employees involved**. In appropriate cases an averaging approach can be applied to the calculation of the car benefit charge. In effect, a single notional car is substituted for the multitude of actual cars available to these particular employees.\n\nThe averaging procedure will mainly affect:\n\n*   employees in the retail motor trade\n*   employees in the motor leasing and hiring trades\n*   other employees in the motor trade who have very frequent changes of cars.\n\nBut you should exclude those employees who have a particular car allocated to them on an exclusive basis for a predictable period of time. For example, an employee who gets a different car made available once a month would not come within the arrangements.\n\nAverages should be agreed for both:\n\n*   the price of the notional car (the figure at step 4 of the calculation in Section 121(1) ITEPA 2003, see [EIM23760](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23760)) and\n*   the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions figure of the notional car, see [EIM23765](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23765).

So the averaging method should be based on the facts regarding the type and frequency of use of the cars actually made available to each employee. In particular, there should be no reduction of benefit charges beyond that provided for in the legislation, nor should the employees and directors be treated as if they had cars of lower prices than those actually made available to them.

For certain types of test such as cold starting, the only practical way of conducting them is for the engineers concerned to use the cars for private journeys and to report on their performance.\n\nIn law, private use of the test car inevitably results in car benefit being chargeable.  However, HMRC will not apply car benefit where the primary use of the car is for testing and any private use is clearly subsidiary to that testing.\n\nWhere the employees concerned have another car benefit car allocated to them on a permanent basis and they use the test car instead, the test car can be regarded as a replacement car ([EIM25125](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24000#EIM25125)).  In such cases, no separate tax charge arises because of its use.\n\nWhere, however, the test car is used in addition to the normal car (for example, if the normal car is used by family members while the employee has the test car for private use), car benefit will be chargeable on the test car unless the &#x201C;primary use&#x201D; condition described above is met.\n\nWith the same exception, car benefit may apply where the employee is not chargeable to car benefit on their normal company car.  For example, car benefit will apply where test cars are used for an employee's holiday travel.\n\n### 2008/09 and earlier years\n\nThis guidance applies only for 2009/10 and later years.

Where, as part of the normal duties, a director, car salesperson or demonstrator takes a car home for the express purpose of calling on a prospective customer, or servicing staff take a car home overnight as part of a collection and delivery arrangement with a customer, the car will not on that account alone be treated as available for private use.

These cars are averaged (as detailed on later pages of this guidance) into the notional cars for each group for that tax year.\n\nAt new car dealerships, this typically means all demonstrators (including those being used by customers when the count is done) plus any other cars actually available to employees, so long as those cars are available for private use by employees (including travel between home and work).\n\nParticularly in leasing and daily rental businesses and fleet operators, HMRC accepts that not all cars on the premises on the date the sample is taken in each year are available to employees for private use.  HMRC will be guided by decisions on this made by the employer so long as procedures are in place under which the employer monitors use in practice and takes action if employees fail to abide by the employer&#x2019;s rules.\n\nAll employers will need to be able to demonstrate what their policies are in theory and how those policies are put into effect and monitored in practice.\n\nThe details to be identified for each car are:\n\n*   list price of the car and any accessories fitted to it, including delivery and VAT (do not cap this at &#xA3;80,000 at this stage, even for 2009/10 or 2010/11)\n*   CO2 emissions figure*   fuel\n\nExceptions:\n\n*   if a car does not have a list price, the notional price ([EIM24150](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24000#EIM24150)) is to be used instead\n*   if the car does not have a CO2 emissions figure, see [EIM23835](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23835).\n\nSee [EIM23875](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23875) for how this step operates in multi-franchise locations.\n\nStep 2 can be found at [EIM23840](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23840).\n\n### Special rule for daily rental businesses\n\nInstead of counting the cars available at each location, daily rental businesses may use details of the cars in their entire fleet in which private use by staff is permitted.

The employer simply allocates each member of staff to a group, thus determining which cars are available to them.  This may be done on an individual basis or by job type (e.g. sales executive, service manager).  The number of employees at a location allocated to a group may not exceed the number of cars in that group at that location, but all groups at a location must be populated with employees because those groups only contain cars which are available to employees for private use.\n\nThere are three main exceptions to this standard pattern:\n\n*   an employee joining during the year is allocated to the appropriate group from the date on which they are first entitled to use a grouped car.  A form P46(car) is completed using the details of the notional car for that group and the date goes onto their first form P11D.\n*   an employee leaving during the year: a P46(car) is completed showing that the car has been withdrawn and the date of leaving goes onto their final P11D.\n*   an employee who changes their job during the year may move up or down a group.  No P46(car) is required (though the employer may complete one if they wish) and they are shown on form P11D as having two cars available in succession during the year, the first up to and the second from the date of change.\n\nIf an employee uses a car of a different group, see [EIM23875](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23875).\n\n### Special rule for daily rental businesses\n\nThese rules apply where only one grade or kind of employee is allowed to use cars privately at each location and that employee is instructed to use a car from the lowest available group.  Each employee should be allocated to the group set by the rental business with an average price immediately below the average for all available cars as determined at Step 3 ([EIM23845](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23845)).   They are deemed to use a car in that group, even though they may be allowed to use and actually use cars from higher and lower groups depending on availability.\n\nIf an employee has a free choice of what car to use, the average price determined at Step 3 should be used and the CO2 emissions figure calculated for that car using the rules at Step 4 above.\n\n### 2008/09 and earlier years\n\nThis guidance applies only for 2009/10 and later years.

If, however, staff at each franchise primarily use cars from that franchise, separate groupings should be created for each franchise.\n\nEqually, if a franchise actually provides cars from another manufacturer for its staff to take home and its demonstrators are not in fact used privately, the groups are constructed from the cars not allocated to individuals but actually available to staff for private use (see step 6 at [EIM23860](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23860)).\n\n### Employee uses car of a different group\n\nThe normal rule is that an employee must use a car of the group to which they are allocated.  However, there will inevitably be occasions when this is not possible.\n\nThe rules for replacement cars at [EIM25125](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24000#EIM25125) are adapted to this situation.  No charge will be made for the replacement car (whether of a higher or lower group) if\n\n*   it is not materially better than the normal (i.e. notional) car, or\n*   it is not made available under an arrangement of which the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is to provide the employee with the benefit of a car that is materially better than a car of the group to which they are allocated.\n\n### Only one car in a group\n\nAs the example at [EIM23870](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23870) shows, it is possible for there to be only one car in a group.  It might appear that the employer cannot use these averaging arrangements in such situations.\n\nThat is not the intention.  As long as the employee works in the kinds of business described at [EIM23815](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23815) and does not have a car allocated to them, so qualifying to be allocated to a group, we allow employers to use these simplified arrangements even though there is only one car in a group.

There is an index to the guidance on car fuel benefit at [EIM25500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500).\n\nEmployers who operate car dealerships inevitably provide fuel for their cars, e.g. for demonstration drives.  It follows that in such cases the car fuel benefit charge has been incurred if the car is available for private use.  In all other situations within the scope of this guidance, fuel is also provided for the car unless the employee personally buys for all fuel (business or private) and is not reimbursed for any of it.  Simply using fuel already in a car and not replacing it constitutes using fuel which has been provided for the car.\n\n### Employers providing private fuel\n\nEmployers may choose to provide private fuel to some or all employees.  They should complete P11D accordingly, using the appropriate percentage for the notional car as determined at [EIM23850](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23850) (also see example at [EIM23870](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23870)).\n\n### Employers NOT providing private fuel\n\nEmployers who choose NOT to provide private fuel to an employee (and therefore believe that the car fuel benefit charge should be nil) must recognise that the legal onus is on them to demonstrate that the statutory conditions at [EIM25555](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500#EIM25555) are met.  They need to be able to prove that, in the tax year, the employee was required to make good the full cost of any fuel used privately on the basis that private mileage was all done in the notional car, and that they have actually done so.\n\nThe advisory fuel rates can be used for this purpose, as described at [EIM25655](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500#EIM25655); it will be necessary to calculate the engine size of the notional car if this option is chosen.\n\nIf they cannot, the full charge (calculated as in [EIM25560](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500#EIM25560)) applies.\n\n### Accounting for VAT on the private use of fuel.\n\nThese arrangements  apply only for income tax and NICs.  They do not affect how VAT is accounted for on any private fuel (see Notice 718 and V1-13 Chapter 19).\n\n### 2008/09 and earlier years\n\nThis guidance applies only for 2009/10 and later years.
