{"title":"EIM22105 - Van benefit to 2004/05","details":{"manual-section-id":"EIM22105","body":"This example illustrates:\n\n*   the calculation of the value of exclusive\navailability (see[EIM22080](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22080))\n*   the meaning and effect of when a van is\nunavailable (see[EIM22082](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22082))\n*   the effect of payments for private use of\nsuch a van (see[EIM22084](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22084)).\n\n### Example\n\nOn 6 May 2003 X Ltd buys a van that was first registered on 5\nApril 2000 and makes it available to employee A, who is not in\nlower paid employment. There is no prohibition on private use. On\n30 June the van breaks down and is taken to a garage for repair.\nThe repairs are completed on 13 August and A collects the van that\nday. It remains available to A for the rest of the year. It is\nnever made available to any other employee.\n\n### Calculation of value of exclusive availability\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td></td><td></td><td>**Running total**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Step 1</td><td>The van is aged four\n\nyears or more on 5 April 2004 (see\n\n[EIM22067](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22067)).</td><td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Step 2</td><td>Its basic amount is\n\ntherefore &#xA3;350 (see\n\n[EIM22080](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22080)).</td><td>&#xA3;350</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Step 3</td><td>The van is unavailable to\n\nA from 6 April to 5 May inclusive and from 1 July to 12 August\n\ninclusive (see\n\n[EIM22082](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22082)), a total of 73 days.</td><td>\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td><td>Reduce the value carried\n\ndown from Step 2 by:</td><td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td><td>&#xA3;350 x 73/366 (2004\n\nis a leap year) = &#xA3;70.</td><td>&#xA3;280</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Step 4</td><td>No payments for private\n\nuse, so no adjustment.</td><td>&#xA3;280</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nNote that if the repairs had been completed on 29 July (less\n\nthan 30 days after 30 June) the van would have been treated as\n\navailable even while under repair (see\n\n[EIM22082](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22082)).\n\n### Example of payment for private use\n\nIf A had been required to pay &#xA3;150 for private use of the\n\nabove van and had done so, the charge on A would have been further\n\nreduced by the &#xA3;150 to &#xA3;130.\n\n### Years from 2005/06 onwards\n\nFull guidance on van benefit for these years can be found using\n\nthe contents page at\n\n[EIM22700](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22700).","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM20000","EIM22050","EIM22105"],"sections":[]}}
