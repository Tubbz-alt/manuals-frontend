It may be specified in the agreement with the employer for a company car that the employee must keep the car clean, but that does not mean that washing the car is part of the duties of the employee's employment, see [EIM31650](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31600#EIM31650).\n\nThere may be particular employments whose duties are more likely to include keeping the car clean. This may include a chauffeur or car valet but each case must be considered on its own facts.\n\nThere is no reduction from the car benefit charge in respect of costs of cleaning a company car that are met by the employee, see [EIM23035](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23035).","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
