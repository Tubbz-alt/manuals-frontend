He retires on 30 April 2005 and he is paid his 2004/05 bonus of Â£1,000 when it is due on 5 July 2005. Assuming the employee was resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom in 2004/05 the bonus is chargeable to tax. It will be assessed in 2005/06, which is the year of receipt. PAYE must be applied on payment and paragraph P6 of the Employer's Further Guide still applies.\n\nIf it is contended that post-cessation earnings cannot be attributed to a year when the job was held, see [EIM40005](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM40000#EIM40005).","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
