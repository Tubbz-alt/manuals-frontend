The price of the car for tax purposes is determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 122 to 124 ITEPA 2003.\n\nThe price of the car will usually be based on list price. Different rules apply if:\n\n*   the car has no list price (the notional price is used, see [EIM24150](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24150))\n*   the car is a classic car (see [EIM24400](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24400) onwards)\n*   the car was manufactured as a road fuel gas car (see [EIM24175](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24175)).\n\nNote that the price of the car is **not **the price actually paid by the person providing the car.\n\nAdjustments for accessories (see [EIM24200](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24200) onwards) and capital contributions (see [EIM24350](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24350) onwards) are made in steps 2 and 3. The net result is the price used to calculate the cash equivalent, the price of the car and accessories less capital contributions, at step 4. This should be the same as it would have been under the rules in the previous (ICTA 1988) legislation, despite the different structure.\n\nExamples of the calculation of the price of a car are at [EIM24450](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24450) onwards.

That means you would expect to see the payment made at or about the time when the car or accessory in question is provided. If there is no agreement governing the terms of the contribution then other evidence of a payment by the employee should be sought.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\n### Ownership of the vehicle or accessory\n\nNote that part ownership by the employee is not required by the legislation.\n\n### Other possible payments by the employee\n\nCapital contributions are payments towards the cost of the car or any qualifying accessory. They should not be confused with payments for the private use of the car, which are dealt with separately under Section 144 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM25250](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25250) onwards).
