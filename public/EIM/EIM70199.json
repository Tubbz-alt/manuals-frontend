Where a room is set aside by the teacher at his home for exclusive use as a study, as a broad guideline the allowance to be claimed is calculated by dividing the total running costs of the home by the number of main rooms, that is, omitting bathrooms, lavatories and entrance hall.

Likewise school premises are normally available to teachers outside the hours covered by the school timetable, probably for at least two or three hours each day. The fact that a teacher chooses to work at home (for example, marking) rather than carry the work out at school is essentially a question of personal choice.\n\nAn individual teacher may argue that the facilities at the school are inadequate, or that the work can be done more effectively at home. But this is not enough to permit a deduction under Section 336 ITEPA 2003. The test is what the duties objectively require, that is, whether any teacher holding that post could fulfil the contractual obligations with the facilities the employer makes available.\n\nIf it is contended that the availability of school premises is restricted, an approach should, if necessary, be made to the relevant local authority or head teacher for further information.

It follows that travelling expenses paid to teachers for attendance at such meetings on school premises are earnings of the employment, to which PAYE should be applied by the payer.\n\nThe Order enables head teachers to direct time. When carrying out directed duties, teachers are performing the duties of their employment and travel from home to any such directed functions on the school premises is taxable in the usual way.\n\nThe only circumstances in which expenses paid by the employer for travel between home and a permanent workplace, such as the school premises, remain non-taxable are where the teacher is:\n\n*   not within the benefits code and\n*   not carrying out directed duties.\n\nThis may include, for example, such functions as evening or weekend performances of school plays, concerts and sports functions.\n\nMany local authority employers are unwilling to pay travelling expenses for attendance at school functions. Those that do pay them have a variety of arrangements for doing so and the rate at which they pay also varies.

Although a teacher may feel that the school or college facilities are inadequate, and that possession of their own equipment makes them more effective in their job, the critical question is whether another teacher could carry out the duties (in the sense of fulfilling the contractual requirements) with what the employer provides.\n\nThe position is somewhat different where the teacher or lecturer concerned is under a contractual obligation to undertake academic research at degree level or above. In such cases the academic frequently has not only a degree of choice as to the subject of the research but also as to the way in which it is pursued (see the penultimate paragraph of [EIM36550](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM36550.htm)).
