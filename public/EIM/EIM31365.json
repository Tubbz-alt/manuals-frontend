It covers\n\n*   payments to employees, and\n*   deductions to which employees are\nentitled.\n\nThis page deals with the second of these. The deduction is\ncalled Mileage Allowance Relief (MAR)\n\n### Entitlement to mileage allowance relief\n\nAn employee is entitled to MAR for a year if that employee:\n\n*   uses their own vehicle (car, van, motor\ncycle or cycle) for business travel, and\n*   receives less mileage allowance payments (\n[EIM31230](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM31230.htm)) than the approved amount (\n[EIM31235](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM31235.htm)) applicable to that kind of\nvehicle (\n[EIM31240](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM31240.htm)) for the tax year.\n\n### Calculation of mileage allowance relief\n\nThe same calculation is used to determine both MAR and the\n\nchargeable amount of mileage allowance payments, see\n\n[EIM31235](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM31235.htm).\n\nThe same statutory mileage rates (\n\n[EIM31240](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM31240.htm)) are used to calculate both MAR\n\nand the approved amount. It is therefore impossible for an employee\n\nto be chargeable for mileage allowance payments (MAPs) in excess of\n\nthe approved amount and be entitled to MAR in the same tax year for\n\nthe same kind of vehicle.\n\nThere is no alternative whereby, for example, employees may\n\nclaim for actual expenditure incurred (see\n\n[EIM31335](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM31335.htm))."}]}]}}
