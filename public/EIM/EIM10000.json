Additional tax free payments can be\nmade to employees who carry business passengers.\n\nFull guidance on the AMAP scheme is at\n[EIM31200](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200) onwards.\n\n### Mileage allowance payments for business travel using employee's\nown vehicle or bicycle - 2001/02 and earlier and other travel and\nsubsistence payments - all years\n\nSubject to the special rules that apply to mileage allowance\npayments for 2002/03 onwards (see above) payments made by employers\nto employees in respect of travelling and related subsistence\nexpenses may be taxable as earnings under Section 62 ITEPA 2003\n(see generally\n[EIM00520](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00520) onwards) or, more usually, be\ntreated as earnings by Section 72 (see\n[EIM20601](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20600#EIM20601)).\n\nIn general, if a payment for travelling expenses does no more\nthan reimburse the cost of expenses for which a deduction would be\ndue under Section 337, that payment is not earnings within Section\n62. But, unless the employee is in lower paid employment, the\npayment is treated as earnings by Section 72. Where a payment for\ntravelling expenses is earnings, or is treated as earnings the\nemployee or director may then be entitled to a deduction under\nSection 337 or 338.\n\nFull details of the rules on employee travel expenses are in\n[EIM31800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31800) onwards.\n\nThe following table shows you where to find guidance about\nparticular kinds of travelling and related expenses payments.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Guidance\n\n</td><td>\n\n### Circumstance\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10010](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10010)</td><td>Travel between places of\nwork</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10020](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10020)</td><td>Travel from home to\nnormal place of work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10030](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10030)</td><td>Travel from home where\nhome is a place of work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10040](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10040)</td><td>Emergency call-out:\ntravel between home and normal place of employment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10050](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10050)</td><td>Emergency call-out:\ntravel between home and a place other than a normal place of\nemployment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10060](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10060)</td><td>Travel from home to\nplaces other than the normal place of work: detached duty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10070](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10070)</td><td>Employees with no normal\nplace of work: peripatetic employees</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10080](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10080)</td><td>Disabled persons: home to\nwork travel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10090](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10090)</td><td>Travelling expenses\npayments under assisted travel schemes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10100](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM04700#EIM10100)</td><td>Travel and subsistence:\npublic transport on strike</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EIM10200 onwards</td><td>Late night journeys home\nfrom work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EIM03140</td><td>Reimbursement of extra\ntravelling expenses incurred when an employee has had to move house\non taking up a new job or a job with a new employer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[EIM10300](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM10300)</td><td>Further guidance on\ntravelling expenses in particular occupations</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM00500","EIM04700","EIM10000"],"sections":[]}}
