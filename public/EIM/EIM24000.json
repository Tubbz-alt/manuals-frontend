Full details of the ITEPA method statement are at [EIM24015](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24015.htm).\n\nBroadly, the cash equivalent of car benefit is calculated by multiplying:\n\n*   the price of the car (see [EIM24050](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24050.htm) onwards), plus\n*   the price of accessories for tax purposes (see [EIM24200](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24200.htm) onwards), by\n*   the appropriate percentage (see [EIM24500](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24500.htm) onwards).\n\nThe following are also taken into account:\n\n*   capital contributions by the employee to the cost of the car or accessories (Section 132 ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24350](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24350.htm) onwards)\n*   for years to 2010/11 only, the price (net of capital contributions) is subject to a maximum, Section 121(1) ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24440](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24440.htm); no limit is applied from 2011/12 onwards\n*   periods when the car is unavailable, Section 143 ITEPA 2003, see [EIM25100](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25100.htm) onwards\n*   payments by the employee for private use of the car, Section 144 ITEPA 2003, see [EIM25250](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25250.htm) onwards\n*   if the car is a classic car (Section 147 ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24400](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24400.htm) onwards) some rules are modified\n*   periods when the car is shared, Section 148 ITEPA 2003, see [EIM25200](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25200.htm) onwards.\n\nThe benefit is calculated afresh for each tax year because any of the constituents taken into account in the calculation can change.

The price of the car for tax purposes is determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 122 to 124 ITEPA 2003.\n\nThe price of the car will usually be based on list price. Different rules apply if:\n\n*   the car has no list price (the notional price is used, see [EIM24150](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24150.htm))\n*   the car is a classic car (see [EIM24400](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24400.htm) onwards)\n*   the car was manufactured as a road fuel gas car (see [EIM24175](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24175.htm)).\n\nNote that the price of the car is **not **the price actually paid by the person providing the car.\n\nAdjustments for accessories (see [EIM24200](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24200.htm) onwards) and capital contributions (see [EIM24350](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24350.htm) onwards) are made in steps 2 and 3.

There is nothing within the structure or language of the legislation to warrant that interpretation. It contains no provision for choosing between different prices for the same type of car, as there is only a single list price for each car. To find that single list price the legislation starts with the manufacturer. It is only in the absence of a list price published by the manufacturer that we need to turn to the importer or finally to the distributor.\n\nThis was made clear in Explanatory Note 452 when the Bill that became ITEPA 2003 was before Parliament.

(A business importer of this type is generally a particular type of car dealer or seller and is quite different to the importer envisaged by Section 123(1), see [EIM24110](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24110.htm).\n\nThe fact that a car has been brought to the UK from abroad makes no difference to the approach outlined in [EIM24050](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24050.htm) and EIM24055 to establishing the price of the car. The legislation is framed in terms of the list price for a car of that kind (see [EIM24105](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24105.htm)). Only if there is no list price can any other price (the notional price) be used, see [EIM24100](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24100.htm).\n\nThere is nothing in the words of the legislation to suggest that a different approach is to be taken if the car has been bought overseas, whether or not at a lower price.\n\nSo the first question to ask about any car bought abroad is whether it is one for which there is a UK list price.\n\nIf there is a UK list price, then that is the price for car benefit purposes wherever the car was bought and if not, see [EIM24150](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24150.htm). "},{"manual_section_id":"EIM24120","title":"Step 1, price of the car: carbon offset charges","body":"\n\n## Section 123 ITEPA 2003\n\nThe term &#x2018;list price&#x2019; is defined at [EIM24105](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24105.htm).  The definition includes the words &#x2018;inclusive price&#x2019;, a term which carries its normal English meaning.\n\nSome manufacturers and importers mention Carbon Offset Charges to buyers of new cars.  These are handled in two ways which affect whether the charge is included in the list price for car benefits purposes.\n\n### The charge is payable (the customer may be able to opt out)\n\nBecause the list price is the &#x2018;inclusive price&#x2019;, the carbon offset charge is included in the list price for car benefits purposes in this case.  This is so whether it is included in the published list price or added to it.  The option available to the customer (if they have one) is not to pay it or, put another way, the customer has to take action to avoid paying it.\n\nEven if the customer opt outs and does not pay the charge, it is still included in the list price for car benefits purposes.  This is because this option is treated in the same way as a discount.  No other discount to the inclusive list price affects the price for car benefit purposes; the same is true for carbon offset charges from which the customer can opt out.\n\n### The charge is not payable unless the customer opts in\n\nHere, the charge is not part of the &#x2018;inclusive price&#x2019;.  As a result, it does not form part of the list price for car benefits purposes.\n\nThe option available to the customer is whether to pay it.  They will not have to pay it unless they take action to do so.\n\nBecause no accessory is acquired as a result of paying the charge, neither is it within the kinds of amount to be taken into account under Step 2 ([EIM24200](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24200.htm) onwards).\n\n### Voluntary carbon offset payments after the car is purchased\n\nOwners of cars purchased before the Carbon Offset Charge was introduced are sometimes offered the chance to purchase an identical or similar package.  Such purchases are ignored for car benefit purposes because:\n\n*   they are not part of the list price because the package was not available from the manufacturer at the time the car was purchased\n*   they are not accessories because they are not capable of being &#x201C;attached to the car&#x201D;, Section 125(2)(c)."},{"manual_section_id":"EIM24150","title":"Step 1, price of the car: notional price","body":"\n\n## Section 124 ITEPA 2003\n\nBefore reading the guidance that follows this paragraph, ensure that you are familiar with:\n\n*   the method statement in Section 121(1) ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24015](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24015.htm) (this page concerns step 1)\n*   the general introduction at [EIM24050](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24050.htm)&#xA0;\n*   the flowchart at [EIM24055](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24055.htm)&#xA0;\n*   when the notional price can be used, [EIM24100](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24100.htm).\n\n### Notional price\n\nThis means the price that might reasonably have been expected to be the car&#x2019;s list price if its manufacturer, importer or distributor (as the case may be, see [EIM24110](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24110.htm)) had published a price as the inclusive price appropriate for a sale of a car of the same kind sold:\n\n*   in the United Kingdom,\n*   singly,\n*   in a retail sale,\n*   in the open market,\n*   on the day immediately before the date of the car&#x2019;s first registration and\n*   with accessories equivalent to the qualifying accessories (see [EIM24205](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24205.htm)) available with the car at the time when it was first made available to the employee.\n\nInclusive price has the same meaning as in Section 123 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM24105](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24105.htm)).\n\n### Imported car with no UK list price\n\nAn imported car may not have a UK list price, perhaps because the car is left hand drive, or because it is a model not introduced into the UK market. Where there is no UK list price for a particular car, we must use its notional price (as defined above) instead.\n\nA simple conversion of an overseas list price into sterling is unlikely to result in a figure that equates to the price that might reasonably have been expected to be the UK list price. Depending on the circumstances in the overseas country, the sterling equivalent of the overseas list price could result in a sterling figure that is either higher or lower than the price that might reasonably have been expected to be the UK list price. We must calculate the price of the car for car benefit purposes on the correct statutory basis, irrespective of whether the conversion into sterling of an overseas list price gives rise to a higher or lower figure than the correct amount.\n\nSo if the notional price of a car purchased overseas cannot be arrived at simply by converting the overseas retail price into sterling, how do we calculate it?\n\nThere is no single method of calculation that will result in the right amount in all cases. A couple of examples of the approach to identifying what we would have expected the UK list price to be are set out at [EIM24455](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24455.htm). These examples are not meant to cover all possible scenarios, and other methods may be appropriate, depending on the particular facts and circumstances.\n\n### Particular cars\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, PAYE Technical is prepared to agree a notional price to apply nationally.

If a CRM for a public sector employer is approached to agree that certain enhancements to cars can be exempt they can agree to the request if the employee concerned is sufficiently senior in the organisation.\n\nIt is possible that some employees in the private sector may be provided with security enhancements because of the nature of the work they do.  If a CRM is approached by a private company to agree that certain enhancements to cars can be exempt under this legislation they will need to obtain full details of the nature of employment and the threat it creates.  **(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**&#xA0;"},{"manual_section_id":"EIM24210","title":"Step 2, accessories: standard accessory, non-standard accessory (definitions)","body":"\n\n## Section 125 ITEPA 2003\n\nBefore reading the guidance that follows this paragraph, ensure that you are familiar with:\n\n*   the method statement in Section 121(1) ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24015](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24015.htm) (this page concerns step 2)\n*   the general introduction to the treatment of accessories at [EIM24200](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24200.htm).\n\n### Standard accessory\n\nThis means an accessory equivalent to an accessory assumed to be available with cars of the same kind as the car in question in arriving at the list price.

This right is separate from the price of the plate itself. \n\nThe value of that right is not to be included in the list price or notional price of the car made available to the employee. \n\nYou should also note that the provision of a personalised number plate on a company car will not give rise to a taxable benefit over and above the car benefit charge. This is because of a prohibition on tax charges on other benefits arising in connection with the car, as outlined at [EIM23035](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM23035.htm). The benefit of a personalised number plate is within this prohibition because it is a benefit in connection with the car. \n\nThese comments apply only where an employer, or somebody acting on the employer's behalf, pays for a personalised number plate for a car to which a car benefit charge applies. There is no bar to assessing a benefit if the employer pays for the re-registration of the employee&#x2019;s own car.

They are not meant to cover all possible scenarios, and other methods may be appropriate, depending on the particular facts and circumstances. \n\n### Left hand drive version of a car for which there is a UK list price for the right hand drive version\n\nAssume that the car in question is made by an overseas manufacturer called Offshore. \n\nWe would need to consider a single UK retail customer approaching a UK Offshore dealer seeking an Offshore Auto left hand drive. It is likely that the overseas Offshore factory where the car is manufactured will be making cars of otherwise identical specification for both left hand and right hand drive markets. Therefore, presumably the UK dealer and importer will simply need to arrange for a left hand drive model to be included in a batch of cars for export to the UK. \n\nIt is therefore likely that, assuming that the rest of the specification is identical, the list price for a left hand drive model would not be significantly different from that for a right hand drive model. Although, of course, there might be a premium on the price to reflect the additional trouble taken to export the left hand drive car to an unusual market. \n\nAccordingly, we would expect the notional price of a left hand drive car for which there is a right hand drive version with a UK list price, to be either the same as or higher than the UK list price. \n\nThis assumes that the specifications and qualifying accessories available with the cars are identical. \n\n### Car for which there is no UK right hand drive version\n\nThe approach will vary according to the circumstances and so it is impossible to prescribe a single approach. \n\nConsider the following scenario: \n\n*   the car in question is an Offshore 1.8 Hi-spec, which is marketed in the country of manufacture but not in the UK\n*   there is also an Offshore 1.8 Basic, which is marketed in the UK as well as in the country of manufacture.\n\nOne approach in this case is: \n\n*   look at the percentage price differential between the Basic and the Hi-spec versions in the country of manufacture\n*   apply a similar uplift to the UK list price of the Basic version in order to arrive at a sensible approximation of the UK list price of the Hi-spec version.\n\nAnother approach would be to look generally at the list prices in the country of manufacture and the UK for Offshore cars that are marketed in both countries, in order to see if there is an identifiable trend in the relationship between the overseas and UK list prices (for example, the UK list price is normally the sterling equivalent of the overseas list price plus x%). \n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual_section_id":"EIM24460","title":"Steps 1-4, examples: classic car&#xA0;"},{"manual_section_id":"EIM24465","title":"Steps 1-4, examples: repayment of capital contribution","body":"These examples illustrates the guidance at [EIM24365](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24365.htm).\n\n### Example 1\n\nThe employer purchases a car for &#xA3;20,000 to which the employee contributes &#xA3;4,000.

All cars first registered before 1 January 1998 are dealt with separately, even if they are one of the few with a CO2 emissions figure, see [EIM24950](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24950.htm). \n\nCars sold in the United Kingdom and in other European Union (EU) countries are required to meet safety and environmental standards under European legislation. Each car must conform to a type (of which a sample has been submitted by the manufacturer or importer) that has been approved by a national certification agency. The level of CO2 emitted by the car on a prescribed test cycle is one of the factors recorded during the type approval testing procedure. Very small manufacturers (for example, TVR at the time of writing, February 2003) are excluded. \n\nThe approved CO2 emissions figure for car benefit purposes is that which is recorded on the type approval certificate that summarises the results of the type approval testing procedure. \n\nThe type approval certificate may be either: \n\n*   a UK approval certificate, normally issued under Section 58(1) or (4) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, or\n*   an EU type approval certificate, (as required under European Union Directive 70/156/EEC as amended).\n\nThe type approval certificate is held by the car manufacturer (or importer, if appropriate). It is not held by the owner of the car. It refers to the type of car and not to an individual car. \n\nEach individual car should, from 1 October 1999, also have a unique certificate of conformity, which records the approved CO2 emissions figure for the car obtained from the relevant type approval certificate. But, in practice, manufacturers do not routinely provide certificates of conformity with new vehicles (although vehicle owners can ask for the certificate if necessary). \n\nSo a car has an approved CO2 emissions figure for car benefit purposes if the car is of a type for which the manufacturer has an approval certificate that specifies a CO2 emissions figure in terms of grams per kilometre (g/km) driven. \n\nThe rules operated by the various car registration bodies about what constitutes a type of car are quite broad and car manufacturers have taken different approaches to the amount of detail in which they define a car type.

As explained at [EIM24505](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24505.htm) the manufacturer holds the type approval certificate for each type of car and this is where the approved CO2 emissions figure is recorded for the type to which the vehicle conforms. The manufacturer should provide this information if asked, normally by providing a certificate of conformity (see [EIM24505](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24505.htm)). Although manufacturers are entitled to charge a small fee, some manufacturers are happy to provide this information free of charge.\n*   The Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) supplies CO2 (and other) emissions data in two formats\n\n*   *   on a website at w**ww.vcacarfueldata.org.uk**, and*   in a booklet it publishes called New Car Fuel Consumption and Emissions Figures (though the website is normally more up to date).

But as it is not recorded on the car registration document (V5) the employer will often have to seek information from one of the sources described at [EIM24505](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24505.htm). This should not normally be a problem provided that the employer has correctly identified the key features of the car in question (model, engine size, fuel type, etc). \n\nHowever, there have been a few occasions when employers have found what appears to them to be contradictory information on the SMMT and VCA databases about the approved CO2 emissions figure for the same car. The figures should normally be the same. The figures in both databases are collected from the manufacturer. For this reason there is no need for an employer to check both databases once he or she has found the car and model details for a car of the same type. (See [EIM24505](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24505.htm) about what constitutes a type of car for CO2 purposes). \n\nHowever, if an employer does find an apparent discrepancy: \n\n*   ensure that the employer has correctly identified the model/type details of the car in question\n*   check that the employer is using an appropriate database. Remember that, as the VCA figures relate to new cars currently on sale in the UK, employers will not be able to use the VCA internet database to find the approved CO2 emissions figure for a car sold as new, for example, two years ago. (However, the version of the VCA booklet that was current at the time a car was first registered will provide a useful historical record). If after carrying out these checks there is still a small discrepancy, the employer can use the lower CO2 emissions figure to calculate the car benefit charge.\n*   if, after carrying out these checks there is a large discrepancy, you should obtain full details of the make and model of the car and of the conflicting CO2 emissions figures**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**.\n\n### Car first registered before 1 January 1998\n\nCar benefit is always based on engine size and not on CO2 emissions figures, even if (exceptionally) they exist, see [EIM24975](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24975.htm).

They do show the type approval number but this does not indicate that the car meets the Euro IV standard even if it begins E4.\n\nSo if you are told that a diesel car meets the Euro IV standard and it was either\n\n*   first registered on or before 31 December 2005, or\n*   the year is between 2002/03 and 2005/06 inclusive,\n\nyou will need to ask for evidence to confirm this.

In case of doubt, the statutory definition is that, for the purposes of Section 138, a car has automatic transmission if: \n\n*   the driver of the car is not provided with any means by which the driver may vary the gear ratio between the engine and the road wheels independently of the accelerator or brakes, or\n*   the driver is provided with such means, but they do not include\n\n*   *   a clutch pedal, or\n    *   a lever that the driver may operate manually.\n\n### Meaning of &#x2018;automatic transmission&#x2019; in sections 138 and 124A ITEPA\n\nSee [EIM24905](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24905.htm). \n\n### Drivers with a significant disability but who do not hold a disabled person&#x2019;s badge\n\n**THIS CONCESSION HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM 6 APRIL 2013**\n\nThere will be exceptional cases where a person&#x2019;s disability, although significant, does not qualify them for the disabled person&#x2019;s badge.  Despite this, if that person wants to drive, they have no option but to drive a car with automatic transmission because of their disability.  \n\nThe disabled person&#x2019;s badge is based on ability to walk, so any lower body disability sufficient to prevent a person driving a car with manual transmission will qualify them for the badge.  A person with a lower body disability which is not sufficient to qualify them for a badge will not therefore qualify as an exceptional case within the meaning of these paragraphs.  \n\nHowever, a person with an upper body disability (e.g. a back or arm disability) may be within these paragraphs.  Such a person may be able to walk sufficiently well that they do not qualify for a badge, but still be physically unable to drive a car with manual transmission. \n\nIf you receive representations that a person with an upper body disability ought to be allowed to take advantage of the reduced CO2 emissions figure allowed by this section, you can allow them from 2004/05 onwards to take advantage of this section as though they had a disabled person&#x2019;s badge if you are **certain** that all the other conditions are met.  **(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**&#xA0;\n\n### Other adjustments to the car benefit provisions for disabled drivers\n\nSee [EIM23650](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM23650.htm).

For example, a car may be undergoing extensive repairs at a garage for at least 30 consecutive days. If the car is taken to the garage on 31 March and collected again on 1 May, the car will be unavailable for 5 days in the first tax year and 25 in the next.\n\nThis definition of unavailable relates solely to the type of period for which a car can be treated as unavailable. It does not attempt to define the underlying circumstances in which a car is either available or not available, which is a separate, although connected, issue. So in considering whether or not there is a period of unavailability that qualifies to reduce the amount of the car benefit charge there are two points to address: \n\n*   is the period itself one that can count as a period of unavailability (remember, any interruption in availability of the car must be at least 30 consecutive days to qualify) and\n*   do the facts show that the car was not available to the employee during that period?\n\nThe amount of the car benefit charge for that year of assessment will only be reduced if the answer to both questions is yes. \n\nThe word available is not defined in the legislation. So we apply its ordinary dictionary meaning of \n\n\"capable of being employed with advantage or turned to account; hence, capable of being made use of, at one's disposal, within one's reach\" (Oxford English Dictionary), see [EIM23300](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM23300.htm). \n\nNote that there is no reduction if the car remains available to the employee, but the employee is not available to the car for some reason (for example, because of an extended time out of the country). \n\nSee [EIM25170](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25170.htm) for examples of circumstances when we would accept that a car is not available. \n\nSee [EIM25175](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25175.htm) for examples of circumstances when we would not accept that a car is not available.

If during that period the employee is provided with a replacement car, for example when the normal car is being repaired, the employee is still charged for the full year on the normal car without time apportionment. There could also be a separate charge on the employee for the replacement car. \n\nSection 145 ITEPA 2003 removes the charge on a replacement car in most circumstances where the normal car is not available for less than 30 consecutive days. \n\nThe replacement car is to be regarded as unavailable for that period if: \n\n*   it is not materially better than the normal car (see [EIM25130](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25130.htm)), or\n*   it is not made available under an arrangement of which the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, is to provide the employee with the benefit of a car that is materially better than the normal car (see [EIM25135](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25135.htm)).\n\nIf either of those conditions is met, the availability of the replacement car is not charged as a benefit.

One of them (C) is in an excluded employment, so the legislation requires that the availability of the car to employee C be disregarded. The availability of the car to the remaining employees is therefore half each, so the cash equivalent of the car is allocated:\n\nNote that 100% of the cash equivalent of the car is always chargeable.\n\n### What is a just and reasonable basis?\n\nOther than determining which employees are to be taken into account, the legislation is silent about this.\n\nThere will often be more than one way of deciding what is a just and reasonable basis. It is primarily for the employer and employees to decide this between themselves, bearing in mind that it is the **availability **of the car to each employee that is being taxed. It does not necessarily follow that their basis is not in accord with the legislation if they choose one method and you would have chosen another.\n\nBecause of this, you should generally avoid being drawn into the decision-making process. You should be able to accept the basis on which they agree, unless you find:\n\n*   that less than 100% of the cash equivalent of the car is being taxed, or\n*   that their basis takes advantage of employees&#x2019; different tax rates in a way that does not accord with the underlying facts.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**\n\n### Years before 2003/04\n\nThese arrangements were formerly part of Extra-Statutory Concession A71.

Otherwise the amount of the car benefit charge is the figure at step 7 reduced at step 8 by the amount paid. Note that if the amount paid exceeds the provisional sum at step 7, there is no relief elsewhere for this. \n\nThe reference to the car being available for the employee&#x2019;s private use includes a reference to the car being available for the private use of a member of the employee&#x2019;s family or household. \n\nSee [EIM25255](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25255.htm) on payments for specific supplies or services, such as car insurance. \n\nThis section is subject to the replacement cars provisions of Section 145 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM25125](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25125.htm))."},{"manual_section_id":"EIM25255","title":"Step 8: payments for specific supplies or services","body":"\n\n## Section 144 ITEPA 2003\n\n### CIR v Quigley (67TC535)\n\nBefore reading the guidance that follows this paragraph, ensure that you are familiar with: \n\n*   the method statement in Section 121(1) ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24015](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24015.htm) (this page illustrates step 8)*   the guidance on step 8 at [EIM25250](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25250.htm).\n\nNot all payments by an employee will necessarily qualify as private use payments that reduce the car benefit charge. A payment for specific supplies or services, such as petrol, insurance, or car washing, will not count. This is so, even if the employee is required to make such payments as a condition of having the car available for private use. The reason for this is that a payment made directly for insurance or for some other supply or service is not a payment for private use. This view was upheld by the Court of Session in Scotland in the case of CIR v Quigley (67TC535). \n\nThe judgement in Quigley only applies to payments that are made for the specific service or supply. It does not provide grounds for excluding costs that the employer may take into account as part of the calculation of the amount the employee is required to pay for the private use of the car. When doing this calculation it is not uncommon for the employer to use a formula that recognises car-related costs met by the **employer **such as road tax, servicing costs etc. If it is clear from the terms and conditions governing the availability of the car that the payment is: \n\n*   subject to a requirement in the year to make payments as a condition of the car being available for private use **and**&#xA0;\n*   for that private use\n\nthen the fact that the level of that single private use payment is calculated with reference to specific underlying costs does not change the nature of that payment. So a payment that clearly satisfies these two conditions will qualify to reduce the amount of the car benefit at step 8 in accordance with Section 144 ITEPA 2003, irrespective of the individual components that have contributed to the calculation of that single payment for private use. \n\nIf, unusually, VAT is chargeable in respect of the private use payments, it is the total amount including VAT that qualifies to reduce the benefit charge.

Occasionally the employer is willing to allow an employee to have the use of a more expensive car if the employee pays a monthly sum representing the excess, for example, the additional leasing costs over and above the employer's limit. In these cases the payments do not reduce the benefit charge because they do not qualify as payments for the private use of the car under [EIM25250](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25250.htm). They are merely for the availability of a more expensive car.  The Case of Brown v Ware at the Special Commissioners in 1995 provides support for this view.**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**&#xA0;\n\nHowever, a reduction in the car benefit charge can be made if the rules of the employer's car scheme make it clear that the extra payments are simply components taken into account by the employer when setting the amount of any payments for private use. It must be clear from the terms and conditions governing availability of the car that the payments are: \n\n*   as a condition of the car being available for the employee's private use **and**&#xA0;\n*   are specifically for that private use.\n\nThis will still be the case even if the extra leasing cost is the only component taken into account in setting the amount of the payments for private use. In effect the extra leasing cost is being used as a method (either on its own, or together with other factors) of fixing the amount that the employee is required to pay for the private use of the car (see [EIM25255](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25255.htm)). \n\nIf the employee has simply made a lump sum contribution towards the cost of the car, see [EIM24350](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24350.htm) onwards on the treatment of capital contributions.
