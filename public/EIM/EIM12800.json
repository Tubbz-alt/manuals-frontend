reasons: dismissal, resignation, death, the end of a fixed term, retirement and so on.\n\nWhen an employment comes to an end, an employee often receives a package that includes a variety of different elements. Examples include unpaid salary, damages, a payment in lieu of notice, a payment for a restrictive covenant, compensation for loss of office and the provision of a non-cash benefit after termination. The correct label is not always applied to each.\n\nThere is a logical sequence to follow when looking at a termination payment or benefit.\n\nThe first task is to identify each element within the package. For example, you may only know that &#xA3;x has been paid and enquiries are needed to establish exactly what that &#xA3;x has been paid for. Or it may be described as a redundancy payment but in fact includes some of the examples above. Payments and benefits may be paid under various legal obligations or may be ex-gratia.\n\nFinding the facts may involve interviewing those involved as well as seeing all the documents and notes of meetings.\n\n[EIM12810](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM12810) explains how to proceed once those facts are clear.\n\nFor a list of common questions about termination payments and benefits, see [EIM12830](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12830).\n\n**Note**: the benefits code (see [EIM21007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21000#EIM21007)) does not usually apply after termination of employment.

Guidance on this is at [EIM15010](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM15000#EIM15010) onwards. If those rules apply, you need not consider the Sections below.\n\n*   **first, **consider Section 62 ITEPA 2003: is the payment or benefit earnings from the employment? See [EIM12850](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12850) for the more common termination payments that are within Section 62. Material on earnings generally is at [EIM00600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00600)and subsequent guidance, particularly [EIM00530](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00530) regarding non-money receipts. If Section 62 does not apply,*   **second, **consider Section 225 ITEPA 2003: is the payment or benefit for a restrictive covenant? See [EIM03600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM03600) onwards. If not,\n*   **last, and only if no other Income Tax charge applies (see the last bullet below), **consider Section 401 ITEPA 2003: is the payment or benefit made in connection with termination? See [EIM12850](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12850) onwards. **Note**: it is common for benefits (such as use of a car or medical insurance) to continue through the termination of the employment. See [EIM12815](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM12815) for details of how these are taxed.\n\nThere is a typical example of this process at [EIM13900](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13900).\n\n**Note **that:\n\n*   redundancy payments (as defined in [EIM13800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13800)) will always be within Section 401 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM13000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13000) onwards)\n*   a lump sum from an **approved or registered** retirement benefits scheme is exempt from tax. Pensions Schemes (Technical Advice) can advise concerning such schemes\n*   Section 401 ITEPA 2003 applies only if there is no other charge to income tax. Apart from Sections 62, 225 and 394 ITEPA 2003 mentioned above, other Sections may apply before s401 in particular situations.

For example, an employee\nprovided with private use of a car may, as part of the termination\npackage, continue to use it for a specified period following the\ntermination.\n\nThe resulting interactions between the benefits code (see\n[EIM21001](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21000#EIM21001)) and Section 401 ITEPA 2003 can\nbe complex, but as a matter of practice benefits that straddle the\ntermination should be apportioned on a time basis, those falling\nafter termination being taxed under Section 401 ITEPA 2003 and\ncalculated following\n[EIM13270](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13270). There are examples of this at\n\n[EIM13905](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13905) and\n\n[EIM13906](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM13906).\n\nFor living accommodation, calculate the charge following\n\n[EIM13330](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13330) and then apportion on a time\n\nbasis. For example, if in the year of termination the property is\n\nprovided for 3 months in the tax year following termination, 3/12\n\nof the charge calculated under EIM13330 onwards should be included\n\nin Section 401 ITEPA 2003.\n\n**Note** that Section 401 ITEPA 2003 applies to\n\n**all** employees. An employee may have not been\n\ncharged on a particular benefit during employment under the\n\nbenefits code if the employment was an excluded employment (see\n\n[EIM20007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20001#EIM20007)).

How CAP1 operates is explained at [EIM12825](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM12825). There are some special circumstances in termination cases where the advice to be given goes beyond CAP1, explained in [EIM12827](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM12827). "},{"manual-section-id":"EIM12825","title":"Handling enquiries: application of Code of Practice 10 (COP10)","body":"CAP1 is a statement of HMRC's policy for dealing with enquiries from individuals and can be found on the Intranet. CAP1 requires every assistance to be given in finding answers to customers&#x2019; enquiries. That assistance can vary from handing out a leaflet to a detailed discussion.\n\nTo find out more about when you can rely on advice from HMRC go to http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pdfs/info-hmrc.htm Where the enquiry involves a proposed transaction, the answer can usually only be in the form of guidance and that should be made clear, whether the response is in writing or otherwise. But you should be aware that even where guidance is given we would not seek to retrospectively impose any different result provided that an enquirer has acted in good faith and supplied all necessary information. However, if the guidance we give proves technically wrong we would have to put the correct view in operation for any subsequent transaction.\n\nHowever, for some questions, a formal binding answer should be given (unless the case involves tax planning or avoidance arrangements). This must involve looking at all relevant information about the transaction before giving an answer. **Annex 1 in CAP1** explains what the customer needs to provide you with in this respect. The questions are those involving:\n\nthe interpretation of legislation passed in the last 4 Finance Acts (until August 2002 this included FA 1998 which introduced changes to the taxation of termination payments and benefits, see SE13040)\n\n**Customers may also ask about** Statements of Practice (SPs) and Extra-Statutory Concessions (ESCs). For termination payments and benefits this means:\n\n*   SP2/81: contributions made to a pension scheme as part of termination arrangements (see SE13735). **Note**: this SP was enacted as Section 408 ITEPA 2003 with effect from 6 April 2003 (see [EIM13735](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13735)).*   SP10/81: the meaning of disability (see [EIM13620](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13620))*   SP13/91: voluntary payments on retirement (see EIM15170)*   SP1/94: clearance procedure for redundancy schemes (see [EIM13785](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13785))*   ESC A10 : lump sums from overseas pension schemes (see [EIM15062](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM15062.htm)) and*   ESC A81: legal expenses in termination settlements (see [EIM13740](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13740)).\n\nThis does not mean that you must give a binding opinion on a termination case simply because it includes something affected by one of the above, but it does mean that you **should give an answer** about how the SP or ESC operates in the context of the case. See also [EIM12827](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM12827) (other situations where formal binding advice is given).

These enquiries should be dealt with in the same way as those requiring a formal binding answer (see [EIM12825](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM12825)).

This means dismissal contrary to\nthe provisions of ERA.\n\nIf a complaint is proved a Tribunal has first to decide\nwhether the employer should be required to reinstate or re-engage\nthe employee. If reinstatement or re-engagement is ordered under\nSection 113 ERA, the Tribunal order will specify the date of\nreinstatement (Section 114) or re-engagement (Section 115).\n\nThe Tribunal will also specify the amount payable by the\nemployer to compensate for any benefit (including arrears of pay)\nthat the employee would have had if he or she had continued as an\nemployee for the period from the date of dismissal until the date\n\nof reinstatement or re- engagement. This sum is compensation for\n\nunfair dismissal and so is taxable only under Section 401 ITEPA\n\n2003 so the employer should operate PAYE where the aggregate\n\npayments within that Section exceed &#xA3;30,000 (see\n\n[EIM13530](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13530)). If, exceptionally, there is\n\nas a matter of fact continuous employment between the dates of\n\ndismissal and reinstatement or re-engagement ordered by the\n\nTribunal, any payment for that period is taxable under Section 62\n\nITEPA 2003 (see\n\n[EIM00600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00600)). This may happen where an\n\nemployee is dismissed and immediately re-employed to allow a\n\nprovision to be left out of the contract, and the date of\n\nreinstatement or re-engagement is later than the re-employment\n\ndate.\n\nIf the Tribunal does not order the employee to be reinstated\n\nor re-engaged then it will order the employer to pay compensation\n\nfor the unfair dismissal under Section 112(4) ERA. It may also\n\norder compensation, under Section 117 ERA, where the employer fails\n\nto comply with an earlier decision that the employee be reinstated\n\nor re-engaged. These awards of compensation are for loss of the\n\nemployment and liability will arise only under Section 401 ITEPA\n\n2003 (see\n\n[EIM13000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13000)).\n\nWhen making a complaint of unfair dismissal, an employee may\n\nalso claim that the employer failed to provide him or her with a\n\nwritten statement of the reasons for dismissal.

Compensation for such discrimination may be paid under several different heads, such as for loss of earnings, personal injury, injury to feelings and so on. Each head needs to be considered separately.\n\nSuch payments are taxable only under Section 401 ITEPA 2003. Further, they are only taxable where they are &#x201C;connected&#x201D; (see [EIM13012](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13012)) with the termination (or, less commonly, with a change in duties or earnings) of the employment. If the settlement does not specify what part of the payment is so &#x201C;connected&#x201D;, the facts must be analysed with care and part apportioned, if necessary, on a just and reasonable basis.\n\nAny part of the settlement that can reasonably be attributed to discrimination occurring **before** the termination should be accepted as not being employment income as it is not &#x201C;connected&#x201D; with the termination. However, where the compensation relates only to the consequences of the termination itself, no apportionment will be appropriate. For example, if the compensation is for loss of future earnings (after termination) it is all connected with the termination and Section 401 ITEPA 2003 applies even though the discrimination brought about the termination. If, by contrast, the compensation is for injury to feelings and there was discrimination before termination, then any part of that compensation that is not connected with the termination will not be within Section 401 ITEPA 2003.\n\nThe Special Commissioners&#x2019; Decision in Walker v Adams (SpC344) may be cited in this context. It confirmed that Section 401 applies to statutory discrimination compensation, in this case for loss of earnings resulting from termination after religious discrimination. The statement that a payment made as compensation for hurt feelings was not taxable was based on the Commissioners&#x2019; view that all discrimination took place pre-termination, and was accepted by HMRC on that basis only.\n\nAn example of compensation for discrimination that falls wholly within Section 401 ITEPA 2003 is that paid as compensation for sexual discrimination to members of the armed forces who were once dismissed on becoming pregnant. In that case, the whole payment is &#x201C;connected&#x201D; only to the discrimination suffered in respect of the termination itself and not to any earlier act or event.\n\nAn example of compensation for discrimination that falls only partly within Section 401 ITEPA 2003 is that paid as compensation for sexual discrimination occurring over a period leading up to termination and also inherent in the termination itself. To establish the part within Section 401 ITEPA 2003, the facts need to be examined and a reasonable apportionment agreed. **(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM12970","title":"Employment Tribunals: wrongful dismissal","body":"Complaints of **wrongful dismissal **resulting from the employer's termination of the employment without adequate notice are common.

Redundancy has a special meaning, which is set out at\n[EIM13800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13800).\n\nThe Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that employees made\nredundant must receive a minimum level of compensation for that\nredundancy. This is called a\n**statutory** redundancy payment, for further details\nsee\n[EIM13760](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13760).\n\nIn addition, many employers provide an additional payment for\nthe same reason.

However all payments in respect of a termination must be added together in applying that threshold (see [EIM13530](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13530)).\n\n**Background**\n\nA statutory redundancy payment is due where an employee is made redundant with at least 2 years&#x2019; service. This includes an employee working under a fixed-term contract agreed, renewed or extended since 1 October 2002. Office-holders such as directors qualify if they work under a contract of employment. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 removed the upper age limit of 65 but not the age-banded method of calculating payments (see below). Members of the armed forces, Parliamentary staff, Crown servants and some others cannot qualify.\n\nA statutory redundancy payment is due only where the employee is dismissed (as compared with resignation). For this purpose, an employee volunteering for redundancy is dismissed. If the employee leaves before the redundancy date by agreement, payment remains due.\n\nStatutory redundancy pay is calculated as the total of:\n\n*   for each complete year of service where age during year less than 22, &#xBD; a week&#x2019;s pay\n*   for each complete year of service where age during year is between 22 and 40, 1 week&#x2019;s pay\n*   for each complete year of service where age during year is 41+, 1 &#xBD; week&#x2019;s pay\n\n*   service longer than 20 years does not count\n*   a &#x201C;week&#x2019;s pay&#x201D; is the amount due under the employment contract on the date that the minimum notice of termination was or should have been given.

For example, it is common to make a\npayment in lieu of notice (PILON) on redundancy and that payment\nmay be stated in the contract. But the character of a PILON is not\ncompensation for loss of employment by reason of redundancy and so\nshould never be treated in the same way.

For example, a contractual term\n\nmight provide for payment of a sum to an employee on termination\n\n\"for any reason\". If a redundancy takes place, it might be argued\n\nthat the payment has that character. But tax cases such as Dale v\n\nDe Soissons (32TC118) have established that such a payment is\n\nessentially earnings deferred until termination, rather than\n\ncompensation for loss of the employment. Redundancy may have\n\ntriggered the payment, but any type of termination would have done\n\nso and the character of the payment remains the same whatever the\n\ntrigger is. As earnings, it is taxable under Section 62 ITEPA 2003.\n\nIf by contrast the contractual terms specify redundancy, then\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt it may be accepted that the intention is\n\nto pay compensation for loss of employment by reason of redundancy.\n\nFor example, if the contract says that a payment is to be made on\n\ntermination \"for any reason (including redundancy)\" then it may be\n\ninterpreted as providing such compensation (provided of course that\n\nthere is in fact a redundancy within\n\n[EIM13800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13800)).

The employee is dismissed without notice and the\n\nemployer immediately makes it clear that its discretion to make a\n\npayment under the contract is not being exercised. Negotiations\n\ntake place because the employer (a) prefers to settle the matter by\n\nmaking a payment of damages for breach of contract rather than face\n\nthe expense and uncertainty of legal proceedings by the employee\n\nand (b) believes that the employee has found another job and so the\n\npayment can be less than would be due under the contract (see\n\n[EIM13070](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13070)).
