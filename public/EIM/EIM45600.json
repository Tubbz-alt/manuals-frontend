If a pension arrangement comes within Section 554E,** no** relevant step taken under it will give rise to Part 7A income.  For example, registered pension schemes come within this exclusion.\n\n[EIM45610](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45610.htm) is about Section 554S.  Under Section 554S, a relevant step within Section 554C or 554D does not give rise to Part 7A income if the step is the provision of pension income which is chargeable to income tax under Part 9 ITEPA 2003 or is exempt income (within the meaning of that Part).\n\n[EIM45615](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45615.htm) is about Section 554T.  Section 554T prevents relevant steps from giving rise to Part 7A income if they are taken in respect of sums of money or assets derived from A&#x2019;s pension contributions.\n\n[EIM45620](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45620.htm) is about Section 554U.  Section 554U will prevent Part 7A income arising to the extent that the relevant step is in respect of sums of money and assets derived from &#x2018;taxed&#x2019; contributions to an EFRBS paid before 6April 2006.\n\n[EIM45625](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45625.htm) onwards are about Section 554V.  In summary, Section 554V shelters the capital cost of annuities from Part 7A ITEPA 2003 to the extent that they are bought out of pre-6 April 2011 annuity rights.\n\n[EIM45635](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm) onwards are about Section 554W.  In summary, Section 554W shelters from Part 7A ITEPA 2003 certain lump sums paid from certain pension schemes where the lump sums are paid out of rights accruing before 6 April 2011.\n\n[EIM45645](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45645.htm) onwards are about Section 554X.  Section 554X will prevent most transfers of sums and assets from giving rise to Part 7A income to the extent that they derive from **employer** contributions paid before 6 April 2006 to schemes that HMRC accepted as corresponding to approved pension schemes.\n\n[EIM45655](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45655.htm) is about regulation 3 of the &#x2018;Excluded Relevant Steps Regulations 2011&#x2019;.

On such relief, see RPSM00500400 onwards.\n*   The contribution is not a repayment of any loan, nor does it have anything else to do with any loan.\n*   The contribution has nothing to do with a sum of money or asset which has been the subject of a relevant step within Section 554C(1)(d).

In this context, &#x2018;accrued by that time&#x2019; refers to the fund value at that time plus later investment growth up to the time of the annuity purchase.\n\nSuppose that on 5 April 2011 a member had the actual or prospective right to receive an annuity:\n\n*   unconditionally,\n*   under a member&#x2019;s election, or\n*   at the option or discretion of the trustee.\n\nThen the intention is that the value of relevant steps taken in the process of purchasing, transferring or paying the annuity will be excluded from Part 7A income  but only to the extent that no other rights are involved (such as those arising from contributions paid after 5April 2011).\n\nThe detailed time-test for whether the member had such a right to receive an annuity (whether by explicit provision, by election, by trustee&#x2019;s option or by discretion) is that the right to receive an annuity:\n\n*   could have been exercised at 5 April 2011, or\n*   could have been exercised at that date had the member met the sufficient conditions (for example, around age).\n\nFor the purposes of this test, it does not matter if:\n\n*   the right is exercised later, or*   the purchase amount includes growth occurring after 5 April 2011.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45625.htm#top)\n\n\n## Relevant step taken by the purchaser\n\nThere are three scenarios in which a relevant step taken by the purchaser will not give rise to Part 7A income.

The accruals in the fund consist of both contributions and income.\n\nOn 1 February 2012, the EFRBS purchases for A an annuity contract in respect of A's rights under the scheme for &#xA3;1million.  Of the &#xA3;1 million, &#xA3;900,000 is attributed to rights accrued before 6April 2011.  The purchase of the annuity is a relevant step within Section 554C.\n\nOn entering into the annuity contract, the insurance company earmarks the consideration with a view to making the annuity payments to A.  This is a relevant step within Section 554B, and the arrangement outlined in this example is likely to come through the Section 554A gateway (see [EIM45025](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45025)).  The annuity payments made under the contract will be further relevant steps within Section 554C.\n\nThe rights out of which the annuity contract was purchased accrued partly out of pre-6 April 2011 annuity rights.  So, an apportionment is needed.\n\nThe consideration needs to be apportioned between A&#x2019;s &#x2018;pre-6 April 2011 rights&#x2019; and A&#x2019;s other rights.\n\nA's pre6April 2011 rights consist of:\n\n*   contributions made before 6 April 2011, and\n*   growth on those contributions up to the time of the annuity purchase.\n\nA&#x2019;s other rights consist of:\n\n*   contributions made after 5 April 2011, and\n*   growth on those contributions up to the time of the annuity purchase.\n\nOn a just and reasonable basis, A&#x2019;s pre-6 April 2011 rights (see above) are valued at &#xA3;900,000 and A&#x2019;s other rights are valued at &#xA3;100,000.\n\nSo, Section 554V treats the EFRBS&#x2019; purchase of the annuity as two separate relevant steps:\n\n*   one in relation to the annuity contract so far as it is purchased out of rights which are pre-6 April 2011 annuity rights, and\n*   one in relation to the annuity contract so far as it is purchased out of other rights.\n\nAs noted above, the former step is valued at &#xA3;900,000.  Section 554V stops it giving rise to Part 7A income.\n\nThe latter step is valued at &#xA3;100,000.  As far as Section 554V is concerned, there is nothing to stop it giving rise to Part 7A income.\n\nThe same apportionment will apply to relevant steps arising upon the insurance company&#x2019;s act of earmarking assets in readiness to pay pension and for the pension payments.\n\nDepending on the facts, however, other reliefs in Part 7A may reduce the value or impact of these steps.\n\n*   Section 554S is likely to exclude relevant steps that are also pension payments  see[EIM45610](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45610.htm).\n*   Overlap relief under Section 554Z5 may apply  see [EIM45725](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45725.htm)."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM45635","title":"Retirement benefits etc","body":"\n\n## Section 554W ITEPA 2003\n\n[Conditions](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDACGNKF)\n\n[Relevant benefit](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDA4GNKF)\n\n[Relevant scheme](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDAMHNKF)\n\n[Pre-6 April 2011 lump sum rights](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDACINKF)\n\n[Sourcing](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDAEKNKF)\n\n[Implications for the anti-forestalling rules](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDATLNKF)\n\n[How Sections 554T to 554X are related](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#IDAPMNKF)\n\nIn summary, Section 554W shelters from Part 7A certain lump sums paid from certain schemes where the lump sums are paid out of rights accruing before 6 April 2011.\n\nSuch lump sums remain chargeable to income tax as employment income under Section 394 ITEPA 2003.\n\nThere is an illustrative example in [EIM45640](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45640.htm).\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45635.htm#top)\n\n\n## Conditions\n\nThree conditions must be met.
