calculated separately and under different rules, it is essential to know when a van is a shared van.\n\nA van is a shared van for a period if either Condition A or Condition B is met.\n\n**Condition A **is met if throughout the period the van is available concurrently (i.e. at the same time) to more than one employee of the same employer.\n\n**Condition B **is met if:\n\n*   the period is one throughout which the van is available to different employees of the same employer (a &#x201C;shared period&#x201D;) and\n*   the circumstances are such that the employee or employees to whom the van is available at any given time in the period are not necessarily the same as those to whom it is available at any other given time in the period.\n\nIn other words, a van is a shared van for any period (other than an exclusive period (see [EIM22072](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22072))) throughout which it is available to different employees (see example at [EIM22107](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22107)).\n\nIf a van is a shared van for any part of a day it is treated as a shared van for the whole of that day (Section 156(5) ITEPA 2003).\n\nNote

Driving is shared between them and at night they take it home\nin rotation.\n\nOn 25 September X Ltd acquired a brand new van in addition to\nthe old van. That day D and E travelled to work in the old van and\nafterwards each of them used the new van for alternate fortnights.\nC now had exclusive use of the old van to get from home to work and\nback.\n\nOn 2 January 2004 C began to share the old van for travel\nbetween home and work with a new employee, F.\n\nOn 1 March, E left, after which the new van was available\nexclusively to D until 1 April, when D also left and the van was\nsold.\n\nNone of the employees is in lower paid employment and none of\nthem pays anything for private use of the vans.\n\n**The old van** (all dates are inclusive):\n\n*   is shared by C, D and E throughout the\nperiod 6 April to 25 September (173 days)\n*   is used only by C from 26 September to 1\nJanuary, a 98 day exclusive period (see[EIM22072](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22072))\n*   is shared by C and F from 2 January to 5\nApril (95 days)\n*   is not a shared van for the 98 day\nexclusive period (see[EIM22072](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22072)).\n\n**The new van:**\n\n*   is shared by D and E from 25 September to\n1 March (159 days; they have it alternately for periods not\nexceeding 30 days)\n*   is used only by D from 2 March to 1 April,\na 31 day exclusive period (see[EIM22072](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22072))\n*   is incapable of use (see[EIM22095](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22095)) from 6 April to 24 September\n(172 days) and 2 April to 5 April (4 days) because it was not owned\nin those periods.\n*   is not a shared van for a total of 207\ndays (31+172+4).\n\nNote that any apportionment is based on the number of days in\nthe year, Sections 158(3) and 163(1) ITEPA 2003.
