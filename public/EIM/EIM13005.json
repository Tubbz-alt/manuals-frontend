In particular, if a payment has its source in the\nterms of employment it is not compensation for loss of employment,\n\nbut rather earnings from the employment chargeable under Section 62\n\nITEPA 2003 (see\n\n[EIM00630](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00630.htm) to EIM00635,\n\n[EIM12850](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM12850.htm) and\n\n[EIM13920](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13920.htm)).\n\nCompensation for loss of employment by reason of redundancy\n\nwill always be within Section 401 ITEPA 2003 (see\n\n[EIM13750](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13750.htm)).\n\nIf compensation appears excessive, see\n\n[EIM12852](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM12852.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Salary or wages in lieu\n\nof notice.</td><td>Section 401 ITEPA 2003\n\napplies where the employee is entitled only to notice but the\n\nemployer fails or refuses to give it (see\n\n[EIM12978](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM12978.htm)).\n\n**Note** that Section 62 ITEPA 2003 applies if the\n\nterms and conditions of employment are the source of the payment\n\n(see\n\n[EIM12976](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM12976.htm)) or if there is a custom or\n\npractice (see\n\n[EIM12977](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM12977.htm)).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Damages for breach of\n\ncontract of employment.</td><td>Section 401 ITEPA 2003\n\napplies if the payment or benefit is compensation for cancellation\n\nof the service agreement (see\n\n[EIM13922](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13922.htm)).\n\nSee\n\n[EIM13070](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13070.htm) regarding the proper\n\ncalculation of damages.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Redundancy payments.</td><td>See\n\n[EIM13750](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13750.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certain compensation paid\n\nunder the Employment Rights Act 1996.</td><td>See\n\n[EIM12950](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM12950.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n**\n\nNote**\n\nthat:\n\n*   a gratuity given on or after retirement is\n\n    taxed under Section 394 ITEPA 2003 in priority to Section 401 ITEPA\n\n    2003, see\n    [EIM15000](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM15000.htm) and subsequent guidance\n*   a lump sum to commute (replace) a pension\n\n    or pension rights may be excepted (see\n    [EIM13660](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13660.htm)) or, in the case of a payment\n\n    to commute pensions from non-approved or employer-financed\n\n    retirement benefits scheme, chargeable under Section 394 ITEPA 2003\n\n    (see\n    [EIM15000](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM15000.htm)).\n\nPayments chargeable under Section 401 ITEPA 2003 are subject to\n\ncertain exceptions and reductions, see\n\n[EIM13500](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM13500.htm).","sections":[]}}
