As for other telephones, see [EIM32940](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM32940.htm), a deduction can be permitted for the actual cost, necessarily incurred, of telephone calls made by the employee in the performance of the duties of the employment.\n\nMobile phone tariffs can be complex and it is not always easy to determine the actual cost of a business call. Some tariffs include a certain amount of free time in the rental charge. In these cases there may be no cost to be deducted. A typical case is illustrated by example [EIM32951](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32951). In other cases you should approach the matter in a reasonable way and give an appropriate deduction that reflects the actual cost to the employee of business calls.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
