This means that a car benefit charge will automatically apply provided the other conditions in Section 114 ITEPA 2003 are satisfied (see [EIM23020](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23020)).\n\nHowever, there is an escape from this automatic treatment. The car benefit charge will not apply if:\n\n*   the terms on which the car is made available prohibit private use ([EIM23405](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23405)) **and**&#xA0;\n*   it is not in fact used privately ([EIM23410](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23410)).\n\nNote that there are two parts to this test, both of which must be satisfied. The mere prohibition of private use is insufficient on its own to prevent a tax charge. It is also necessary to show that a car is not used for private motoring.\n\nThus a provided car will result in liability even if no private use is made of it unless such private use has been specifically prohibited in advance (precisely because it is available).\n\nSimilarly, even if the director or employee shows that private use of a car has been specifically forbidden there must be no private use of it if a charge is to be avoided.\n\nIn some cases it will be quite clear from the facts that private use is prohibited and never takes place. However, you may come across cases where it is less clear that the two parts of this test are satisfied. Where you need to give detailed consideration to whether or not the test is satisfied, you need to ascertain:\n\n*   all the facts surrounding the circumstances of the claimed prohibition and\n*   irrespective of any prohibition, how the car was in fact used.\n\nA key point that you should bear in mind is that it is the tax definition of private use that counts (see [EIM23305](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23305)) and not the employer's. So if the employer bans what it calls private use, but does not include travel between home and the permanent workplace in that ban, the ban will not be effective for tax purposes.\n\n### Summary\n\nBoth parts of the statutory condition must be satisfied:\n\n*   there must be an **express, legally enforceable** ban on private use, and\n*   the taxpayer must be able to demonstrate as a matter of fact that there was no private use."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23450","title":"Exceptions: pooled cars and vans","body":"\n\n## Sections 167 and 168 ITEPA 2003\n\nSome employers, or groups of employers, find it convenient to have one or more cars or vans that are readily available for business use by a number of employees. The cars or vans are not allocated to any one employee and are only available for genuine business use. Such cars and vans are usually known as pooled cars and vans.\n\nSections 167 and 168 ITEPA 2003 ensure that no car or van benefit arises on a pooled car or van made available by reason of the employment that, in the relevant tax year, satisfies **all **the following conditions:\n\n1.  it was made available to, and actually used by, more than one of those employees\n2.  it was made available, in the case of each of those employees, by reason of the employee's employment\n3.  it was not ordinarily used by one of those employees to the exclusion of the others\n4.  in the case of each of those employees, any private use of it made by the employee was merely incidental to the employee's other use of it in that year (see [EIM23455](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23455)), and\n5.  it was not normally kept overnight on or in the vicinity of any residential premises where any of the employees was residing, except while being kept overnight on premises occupied by the person making it available to them (see [EIM23465](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23465)).\n\nFor the purpose of these five conditions all employees should be considered, including those in excluded employments, who would not be chargeable to tax even if the car or van were available for their private use.\n\nThe conditions to be met are essentially questions of fact. Each of them has to be considered in turn. It is not enough that a car satisfies any four of them and narrowly fails the fifth. It must satisfy all five conditions.

The decision in Pepper v Hart (65TC421) on marginal cost does not apply in these cases. However, particular problems arise in the motor industry in connection with demonstration, test and experimental cars.\n\nWhere, as part of the normal duties, a director, car salesperson or demonstrator takes a car home for the express purpose of calling on a prospective customer, do not on that account alone treat the car as available for private use. In essence, the whole journey is for a genuine business purpose. If, however, such a car is otherwise available for the employee's private use, for example, at weekends or holidays, the appropriate car benefit will be chargeable.\n\nThe use for testing purposes of experimental/developmental cars by engineers in both the motor and motor components industries should be looked at in the light of all the facts. Generally speaking, it is unlikely that a tax charge will arise. If, however, you find that such a car is used privately, the appropriate car benefit will be chargeable.\n\nYou will find below an extract from a circular dated 28 September 1976 and issued by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) to its members and to which the then Board of Inland Revenue offered no objection. You can regard this extract as amplifying the second and third subparagraphs of this instruction above.\n\n### Extract from the circular\n\n\"**Use of company-owned cars within the motor industry**&#xA0;\n\n**i) Demonstration cars**\n\nThe Revenue do not consider that the fact that a car is the tool of trade for the car salesman is sufficient reason for introducing special arrangements.\n\n**ii) Frequent changes in the cars allocated to employees**\n\nIt is common practice, both in the motor manufacturing industry and the retail motor industry, for cars available to employees to be changed frequently for sales promotion reasons. This could lead to problems in determining the correct charge to tax as individual cars are likely to fall into different taxable benefit categories. The Revenue recognises the need for administrative simplicity and the need to avoid both the Revenue and companies becoming involved in detailed records for each car. In such cases local Inspectors will be permitted to agree with companies an appropriate mean charge to benefit.\n\n**iii) Test and experimental cars**\n\nTest engineers in both the motor industry and the components industry are often required, as part of their jobs, to test cars under various driving conditions. For certain types of test such as cold starting, the only practical way of conducting them is for the engineers concerned to use the cars for private journeys and to report on their performance. In almost all cases the employees concerned have another company-owned car allocated to them on a permanent basis.\n\nNo general ruling can be made in such cases as the employee's tax position would depend on the facts of individual cases. It is clear, however, that in cases where the employees concerned have the use of a company-owned car on a permanent basis, the occasional use of a test car for private journeys would not give rise to an additional charge to tax. Inland Revenue would, however, look closely at the use made of test cars and are unlikely to take a sympathetic view in cases where, for example, test cars are used for an employee's holiday travel.\"\n\n### 2009/10 and later years\n\nSee [EIM23800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23800) onwards."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM23800","title":"Special cases: employees in the motor industry (years from 2009/10)","body":"All employees chargeable to car benefit are subject to exactly the same legislation.
