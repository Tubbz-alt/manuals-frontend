This applies to all those chargeable under the benefits code, i.e. directors and employees except those in an excluded employment; see [EIM20007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20007) for full details.\n\nFinance Act 2004 changed the van benefits regime with effect from 2005/06.  It repealed former sections 155 to 166 (which related to years to 2004/05) and replaced them by new sections 155 to 164 (relating to 2005/06 onwards).  There is a summary of the new regime in table form at [EIM22702](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22702) and details of the two-stage transition at [EIM22705](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22705).\n\n### Scope - Section 114(1,3)\n\nIn a similar way to the car benefit regime, van benefit applies when:\n\n*   a van ([EIM22725](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22725))*   is made available ([EIM23200](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23200))*   to an employee (including a director) not in excluded employment ([EIM20007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20007))\n*   or to a member of their family or household ([EIM20504](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20504))*   &#x201C;without any transfer of the property in it&#x201D; ([EIM23205](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23205))*   by reason of the employment ([EIM20504](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20504))*   and is available ([EIM23300](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23300)) for private use ([EIM22740](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22740)), and\n*   the benefit of the van does not constitute earnings from the employment by virtue of any other provision ([EIM22770](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22770)).\n\nSome references above are written in terms of cars; the same rules apply to vans in those cases.\n\nUnlike cars, there must be some actual private use before the van benefit charge is incurred ([EIM22745](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22745)).\n\n### Situations where the van benefit charge does not apply\n\nLike the cars regime, the van benefit charge does not apply to\n\n*   pooled vans ([EIM23450](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23450) onwards)\n*   emergency vehicles ([EIM22775](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22775)).\n\nUnlike the cars regime, it does not apply to\n\n*   vans where private use is nil or insignificant ([EIM22745](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22745))\n\nNor does it apply to\n\n*   heavy goods vehicles (those with a design weight over 3,500 kg; [EIM22990](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22990))\n\n### The cash equivalent\n\nFor a description of how the van benefit charge is calculated, see [EIM22790](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22790).\n\n### Examples\n\nThese begin at [EIM22870](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22870).\n\n### Years to 2004/05\n\nFull guidance on van benefit for these years can be found using the contents page at [EIM22050](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22050)."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM22702","title":"Van benefit from 2005/06:\nstructure (table)","body":"The following table summarises liability to van benefit from\n2005/06 onwards:\n\nAbbreviations used are:\n\n*   avail: contractual availability\n*   BU = business use\n*   comm. = commuting use only\n*   other = all private use other than\ncommuting\n*   full charge = the age-related\n&#xA3;500/&#xA3;350 for 2005/06 &amp;

There is also no residual liability to charge on any benefit in connection with the van other than those noted above, so a benefit charge cannot also be made on the provision of, for example, insurance for the van.\n\nBut this exemption from the residual liability to charge for benefits in connection with the van does not extend to benefits that are also enjoyed by the employee when using a car or van for which that employee is not chargeable to tax, including their own vehicle. For example, the provision of a season ticket for a toll bridge.\n\nThere is also legislation forbidding any charge under other employment income provisions in addition to the van benefit charge for:\n\n*   the discharge of any liability of the employee in connection with the van - see [EIM00580](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00580) onwards, Section 239(1))\n*   the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the employee in connection with the van (see [EIM20601](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20601), Section 239(2)).\n*   the use of a non-cash voucher or credit token to obtain, either directly or indirectly, goods or services in connection with the van (see [EIM16100](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM16100) and Section 269(1)).\n\nThere is no charge to tax for a mobile telephone fitted to a van, see [EIM21780](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21780) onwards.

For example, a van may be undergoing extensive repairs at a garage for at least 30 consecutive days.  If the van is taken to the garage on 31 March and collected again on 1 May, the van is unavailable for the 30 day period from 1-30 April, 5 days in one tax year and 25 in the next.\n\nThis definition of unavailable relates solely to the type of period for which a van can be treated as unavailable. It does not attempt to define the underlying circumstances in which a van is either available or not available, which is a separate, although connected, issue. So in considering whether or not there is a period of unavailability that qualifies to reduce the amount of the van benefit charge there are two points to address:\n\n*   is the period itself one that can count as a period of unavailability (remember, any interruption in availability of the van must be at least 30 consecutive days to qualify) and\n*   do the facts show that the van was not available to the employee during that period?\n\nThe amount of the van benefit charge for that year of assessment will only be reduced if the answer to both questions is yes.\n\nThe word available is not defined in the legislation.
