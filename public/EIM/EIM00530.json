Such profits are\noften called benefits in kind.\n\nSome benefits in kind count as earnings within Section 62\nITEPA 2003 (see\n[EIM00520](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00520.htm)). Others may be treated as\nearnings under the benefits code (see\n[EIM00513](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00513.htm)). In most cases, the benefits\ncode only applies to benefits that are not otherwise chargeable to\ntax. So if a benefit is fully taxable as earnings under Section 62\n(because it represents money's worth - see below) the benefits code\nwill not apply.\n\n\n\n### Meaning of money's worth\n\nBenefits that are money's worth count as earnings under Section\n\n62 ITEPA 2003. Section 62(3) defines money's worth as:\n\n*   something that is of direct monetary value\n\n    to the employee, or\n*   something that is capable of being\n\n    converted into money or something of direct monetary value to the\n\n    employee.\n\nThis definition preserves the two aspects of money's worth that\n\nwere previously derived from case law. The law has not been\n\nchanged. As before, a benefit is taxable as earnings if:\n\n*   it is capable of being turned into money\n\n    in the employee's hands (see\n    [EIM00540](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00540.htm) to EIM00570), or\n*   it consists of the discharge of an\n\n    employee's debt (see\n    [EIM00580](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00580.htm)).","sections":[{"title":" Exceptions from the general rule\n\nThere are four provisions in the benefits code that take\npriority over Section 62.
