The employee&#x2019;s own car is used in examples 1 and 2, a company car in examples 3 and 4 (otherwise they use the same facts).\n\n\n\nThe entire passenger payment of &#xA3;6 is therefore exempt because it is less than the approved amount, but no relief is available for the additional &#xA3;4 which could have been exempt had the employer made passenger payments at a higher rate.\n\n### Example 2\n\nThe facts are as in Example 1 except that the employer makes mileage allowance payments of 43p per mile whether or not passengers are carried.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Approved amount for this journey (as above)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2 passengers </td>\n<td>&#xA3;10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passenger payment made</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>nil</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nNone of the 43p per mile is exempt because none of it is paid specifically because passengers are being carried.

The exemption for passenger payments applies to journeys in company cars as it does to journeys in the employee&#x2019;s own car.","sections":[{"title":" Example 1\n\nEmployee J makes a business journey of 100 miles in his own car.
