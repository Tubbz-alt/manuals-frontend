{"title":"Employees using own cars or vans for work: passenger payments: examples","details":{"manual-section-id":"EIM31415","body":"\n\n### Sections 233 &amp; 234 ITEPA 2003\n\nThis page illustrates passenger payments, [EIM31400](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200#EIM31400) onwards.  The employee&#x2019;s own car is used in examples 1 and 2, a company car in examples 3 and 4 (otherwise they use the same facts).\n\n### Example 1\n\nEmployee J makes a business journey of 100 miles in his own car.  He is asked to take two other employees, K and L, as passengers.\n\nThe employer makes mileage allowance payments of 40p (45p from 6 April 2011) per mile and passenger payments at an additional 3p per mile per passenger.\n\nThe calculation for passenger payments only is:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Approved amount for passenger K</td>\n<td>M x R</td>\n<td>100 miles @ 5p</td>\n<td>&#xA3; 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Approved amount for passenger L</td>\n<td>M x R</td>\n<td>100 miles @ 5p</td>\n<td>&#xA3; 5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total approved amount</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>&#xA3;10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passenger payment made</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2 x 100 miles @ 3p</td>\n<td>&#xA3; 6</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThe entire passenger payment of &#xA3;6 is therefore exempt because it is less than the approved amount, but no relief is available for the additional &#xA3;4 which could have been exempt had the employer made passenger payments at a higher rate.\n\n### Example 2\n\nThe facts are as in Example 1 except that the employer makes mileage allowance payments of 43p per mile whether or not passengers are carried.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Approved amount for this journey (as above)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2 passengers </td>\n<td>&#xA3;10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Passenger payment made</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>nil</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nNone of the 43p per mile is exempt because none of it is paid specifically because passengers are being carried.  There is no relief for the &#xA3;10 which could have been exempt had the employer made passenger payments.\n\n### Examples 3 and 4\n\nThe facts are as in examples 1 and 2, except that the car is a company car (a car for which employee J is chargeable to car benefit, [EIM23000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000)).\n\nThe answers are exactly the same.  The exemption for passenger payments applies to journeys in company cars as it does to journeys in the employee&#x2019;s own car.","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM31200","EIM31415"],"sections":[]}}
