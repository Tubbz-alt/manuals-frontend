If it was first registered before that date it will rank\nas over four years old because the cash equivalent is calculated by\nreference to the age of the van at the end of the year of\nassessment.\n\n### Years from 2005/06 onwards\n\nFull guidance on van benefit for these years can be found using\nthe contents page at\n[EIM22700](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM22700)."}]}]}}
