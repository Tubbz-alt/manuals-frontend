The LMC may make\npayments to the part-time committee members. The following tax\ntreatment of those payments was agreed with HM Revenue &amp;\nCustoms in Spring 2006.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThese notes provide guidance on the tax and NICs consequences\nwhere Local Medical Committees (LMCs) make payments to elected\ncommittee members.\n\n### Background\n\nThere are approximately 126 LMCs in the United Kingdom (although\nthere is likely to be a reduction in numbers following a\nreconfiguration of boundries and consolidation of both LMCs) ; one\nfor every Health Authority/ Board. Similar arrangements also exist\nwith the corresponding Boards in Northern Ireland. LMCs represent\nthe interests of General Practitioners (GPs) locally. They are\nrequired to negotiate and consult with the Health Authorities on a\nwide range of issues that may have an impact on all GPs (directly\nand indirectly) and ultimately their patients. LMCs are bodies\ndefined by statute (in England and Wales) and their functions based\nupon a model constitution. In Scotland, the equivalent body is an\nArea Medical Committee although there may be some differences in\ncomposition.\n\nA LMC may appoint staff and appoint GPs from the committee to\nact as Chairman/woman, Treasurer and Secretary (if the Secretary is\nnot already employed). However, most members of a LMC are part-time\ncommittee members who only attend LMC meetings for a few hours each\nmonth. These part-time members are normally local GPs who are\nself-employed professionals drawn from local medical practices.\nThey are elected to represent the interests of GPs in the area\ncovered by the LMC.\n\nMany LMCs pay their elected members for attendance at\nmeetings. Payments are made to defray the expenses of committee\nmembers and to provide some incentive for GPs who undertake such\nwork, which does, necessarily, involve them in some absences from\ntheir practices. Over recent years, the proportion of LMCs making\npayments to their elected members for their committee and other\nwork has increased. These payments are generically referred to as\n&#x201C;honoraria&#x201D;.\n\nSome LMCs, recognising the increasing workload falling on\nbusy GPs, have appointed full-time Chief Executives or full-time\nSecretaries employed under written employment contracts. Such Chief\nExecutives and full-time Secretaries are not LMC members and are,\nas appropriate, subject to PAYE and Class 1 NICs.\n\n### Nature of the appointment\n\nElected LMC members give their time voluntarily and are not\nemployed under contracts of employment. However, because of the way\nLMCs are set up HM Revenue &amp; Customs considers that elected\ncommittee members are office holders.\n\n### Tax consequences\n\nThe strict legal position is that payments to office holders by\nLMCs are taxable as employment income. PAYE should be operated.\n\nHowever, difficulties can arise where a partner holds an\noffice or employment and the fees are to be included with\npartnership income and pooled amongst the partners. This includes\nthe situation where a member of a GP partnership provides his or\nher services as a member of a LMC. In such circumstances, and\nprovided certain assurances are given, you can accept that payments\nto a part-time member of a LMC can be taxed as trading income as\npart of the partnership profits. Further guidance on this and the\ncorrect procedure to follow when asked for such treatment can be\nfound at EIM03000 onwards.\n\nIn legal terms, HM Revenue &amp; Customs, under the powers in\nRegulation 141 SI 2003/2682 (the PAYE regulations) is authorising\nthe payer not to operate PAYE. The use of Regulation 141 means that\nthe recipient cannot, at a later date, claim that there has been a\nPAYE failure and claim a PAYE tax credit. But HM Revenue &amp;\nCustoms will only act under Regulation 141 where the recipient\nagrees in writing to include the fees as self-employed receipts.\n\nThis administrative practice only applies where the LMC fee\nis paid into the partnership accounts and pooled for division\namongst the partners. Where the LMC fee is retained as personal\nincome of the individual committee member it should be taxed as\nemployment income under PAYE. Any honoraria should also be taxed\nunder PAYE.\n\nAs noted above, LMCs may also employ a full-time chief\nexecutive and other staff. The administrative practice outlined\nabove does not apply to payments to full-time members of staff\nwhich should be taxed as normal.\n\n### NICs consequences\n\nThe administrative practice that applies for tax purposes does\nnot apply for NICs purposes. The normal NICs rules apply to\npayments from LMCs to committee members. Where committee members\nare paid for providing their services as office holder to the LMC\nthe payments are liable for Class 1 NICs.\n\nMost LMC members provide their services on a part-time basis.\n\nTypically, this might be for a few hours each month. Daily rates of\n\npayment to a LMC member range up to &#xA3;400, or pro- rota for the\n\ntime of less than one day. The amounts that are repaid are subject\n\nto review on an annual basis.. Therefore most part-time LMC members\n\nwill be paid less than the earnings threshold, in which case there\n\nwill be no Class 1 liability.\n\nFrom April 2003, where payments that are earnings for Class 1\n\nNICs purposes are introduced into the profits of the GP&#x2019;s\n\npartnership they do not need to be included in profits subject to\n\nClass 4 NICs. This follows the introduction of Regulation 4 of The\n\nSocial Security (Contributions) (Amendment No. 7) Regulations 2003\n\n(SI 2003/2958).\n\n### Financial Loss Allowance\n\nRather than paying remuneration to committee members for\n\nproviding their services, LMCs may pay a financial loss allowance.\n\nWhere a financial loss allowance is paid then, for tax purposes,\n\nthe treatment at EIM 01120 can be applied to the payment. Any such\n\npayments to the GP&#x2019;s practice should be taxed as part of the\n\npartnership profits. For NICs purposes there is no Class 1\n\nliability on a financial loss allowance although the payment should\n\nbe taken into account in working out any Class 4 NICs due. Where\n\nthe payment is not actually a financial loss allowance but rather\n\nremuneration calculated to include an amount to cover the cost of\n\nproviding a locum the whole amount is subject to Class 1 NICs.\n\nWhether a payment is a financial loss allowance or something\n\nelse, will depend upon the particular facts. Very broadly, we view\n\nremuneration as something paid to a committee member as a reward\n\nfor services. This is different from a financial loss allowance\n\nwhich is either paid to an individual GP to compensate him or her\n\nfor the reduction in earnings due to his or her absence while\n\ncarrying out LMC duties; or is a payment made to the practice to\n\ncover a hole in the partnership&#x2019;s profits caused by the\n\nGP&#x2019;s absence on LMC business. In order to be treated as a\n\nfinancial loss allowance there must have been a financial loss. So\n\nthere must have been a loss of fee income because the GP was not\n\navailable for work"}]},{"title":" Educational Psychologists &#x2013; trainees","sections":[{"manual-section-id":"EIM61200","title":"Trainee Educational\nPsychologists &#x2013; treatment of educational maintenance payments\nmade during period of university training","body":"Trainee educational psychologists are engaged under contracts of\ntraining for all or part of their training depending on the\nProgramme under which they were trained.

The car benefit charge in Section 114 ITEPA 2003 does not apply to such vehicles. If the vehicle is also used for private purposes there is a residual liability to charge under Section 203 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM21615](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM13310#EIM21615) onwards).\n\nOn the other hand, if a fire officer is provided with an ordinary saloon car, to which the driver may attach a de-mountable flashing light, the car is no different from any other except when attending an emergency. Consequently a car benefit charge applies (see [EIM23015](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000#EIM23015)).\n\n### Boyd and Kerr v Brown (SpC333)\n\nTwo fire officers in Northern Ireland were provided with ordinary saloon cars by the Northern Ireland Fire Service. The cars were used primarily to transport the officers from their home/rented accommodation to the fire stations at which they were based and for travel within their duty areas, but they were also available for the officers to travel directly from home/rented accommodation to an incident, if they were called out whilst on standby duty. The Northern Ireland Fire Service met all the running cost of the vehicles. The officers were not permitted to use the vehicles when off duty.\n\nDue to the security situation in Northern Ireland the cars provided to the two officers had de-mountable blue flashing lights so that they could not be identified as emergency vehicles. When attending an incident the flashing light would be placed on the roof. Although they were not recognisable as emergency vehicles, in the particular circumstances and location of this case, it was agreed that the Inland Revenue would not argue for a car benefit charge but only for a residual benefit charge under Section 203 ITEPA 2003.\n\nThe Special Commissioners found that:\n\n*   the fire station at which each officer was based was his permanent workplace*   consequently travel from home/rented accommodation to the fire station was classed as ordinary commuting (see [EIM32055](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32000#EIM32055)) and provision of a vehicle for this purpose constituted a taxable benefit\n*   the vehicles were provided primarily for Northern Ireland Fire Service purposes and any benefit to the officers was incidental to that\n*   the officers did not use the vehicles on days when they were off-duty, so the benefit charge should be apportioned on the basis of whole days, to exclude off duty days\n*   there should be a deduction under Section 365(1) ITEPA 2003 from the apportioned benefit charge, to reflect the proportion of business mileage relative to the private mileage on journeys between the officers&#x2019; home/rented accommodation and the fire station.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe decision in Boyd and Kerr reflected the unusual circumstances of the case. In particular:\n\n*   where a fire officer is provided with an ordinary saloon car, rather than an emergency vehicle, a car benefit charge applies normally. In Boyd and Kerr it was agreed that, instead of a car benefit charge, there was a charge under the general rules for residual benefits*   the Northern Ireland Fire Service rules did not permit the officers to use the vehicles on off-duty days and it was found as fact by the Commissioners that they did not do so. As a result the Commissioners decided to apportion the benefit. If it had been found that the cars were available for the officers to use on off-duty days, whether or not they were actually used, there would have been be no basis for an apportionment of the benefit.\n\nThe decision in Boyd and Kerr has no effect on other cases where a Fire Service employer provides a car to a fire officer, unless the same circumstances apply. We think that is unlikely.
