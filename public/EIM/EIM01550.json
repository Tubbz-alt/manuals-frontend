{"title":"EIM01550 - Employment income:medical expenses and insurance","details":{"manual_section_id":"EIM01550","body":"An employer may meet the cost of employees' medical expenses or\narrange for them to be met under an insurance policy. The following\ntable shows the tax treatment that applies to the various ways that\nthe employer may do this.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>**Circumstances**</td><td>**Tax treatment**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The hospital etc bills\nthe employee for the treatment. The employer pays the\nhospital.</td><td>The employer has\ndischarged the employee's debt, so the amount paid is taxable as\nearnings within Section 62 ITEPA 2003. See\n[EIM00580](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00580.htm). This applies to all employees\nand office holders.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The employer gives the\nemployee the money to pay the hospital etc. bill.</td><td>The payment counts as\nearnings within Section 62 ITEPA 2003. This applies to all\nemployees. See\n[EIM00520](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00520.htm) onwards.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The employer arranges\nwith the hospital to meet the bill directly - in other words, the\nbill is in the name of the employer, not the employee. (The\nemployer may pay the bill out of its own funds, or out of the\nproceeds of an insurance policy under which the employer is the\ninsured person. The tax result is the same in either case.)</td><td>No tax charge arises on\nlower paid employees. They have not received cash, or \"money's\nworth\" (see\n[EIM00530](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM00530.htm)) so the employer's payment is\nnot \"earnings\" within Section 62 ITEPA 2003. (Lower paid employees\nare those whose total pay, expenses and benefits (including the\ncost of the medical treatment) is at a rate of less than\n&#xA3;8,500 a year, see\n[EIM20100](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM20100.htm)).\n\n All other employees, and directors, are chargeable under\nSection 203 on the amount paid by the employer. See\n[EIM21761](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM21761.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The employer arranges and\npays for a group insurance policy under which employees (and\nsometimes their families) are the insured persons. The employees'\nmedical bills are then met directly by the insurance company.</td><td>There is no tax charge on\nlower paid employees. (Lower paid employees are those whose total\npay, expenses and benefits (including a proper proportion of the\nemployer's medical insurance payment) are at a rate of less than\n&#xA3;8,500 a year, see\n[EIM20100](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM20100.htm)).\n\n All other employees, and directors, are chargeable under\nSection 203 on the premiums paid by the employer. See\n[EIM21761](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM21761.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The medical treatment is\nobtained or the bills are paid by means of vouchers provided by\nreason of the employment.</td><td>All employees are\nchargeable under Section 87 ITEPA 2003. See\n[EIM16140](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM16140.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The employer sets up a\ntrust fund to pay employees' medical bills.</td><td>See\n[EIM21772](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM21772.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The employer pays for\nperiodic medical check-ups for employees.</td><td>See\n[EIM21765](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM21765.htm)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The employer bears the\ncost of medical treatment abroad where the need for the treatment\narises whilst the employee is on duty abroad.</td><td>See\n[EIM21766](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM21766.htm).</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","sections":[]}}
