{"title":"# employer not liable to UK tax","details":{"manual-section-id":"EIM32590","body":"# employer not liable to UK tax\n\nEmployees of concerns within Section 356 ITEPA 2003 (see [EIM32575](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32575)) are not able to claim a deduction for entertaining expenses unless those expenses have been disallowed in computing the employer's taxable profits (see [EIM32585](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM32585.htm)). However, you will sometimes come across employees of concerns that, for one reason or another, are not chargeable to UK tax on their profits. The way in which Section 356 applies to those employees depends on the reason why the employer is not chargeable.\n\nAs regards:\n\n* employers not resident in the UK, see [EIM32595](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32595)\n* employers whose profits are exempt from tax under the terms of a double taxation agreement, see [EIM32600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32600)\n* Local Authority and Health Service employers, see [EIM32605](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32605)\n* charities, see [EIM32610](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32610).\n\nSee also [EIM32612](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM32612.htm) regarding employees of tonnage tax companies.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
