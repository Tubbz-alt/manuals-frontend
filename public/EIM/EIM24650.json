{"title":"Car benefit calculation Step 5, appropriate percentage, 2002/03 to 2011/12: car with an approved CO2 emissions figure: lower threshold","details":{"manual_section_id":"EIM24650","body":"\n\n## Section 139 ITEPA 2003\n\n### Years to which this page applies\n\nThis page applies from 2002/03 to 2011/12 only. The relevant threshold applies to years from 2012/13, see [EIM24655](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24655.htm)**.**&#xA0;\n\n### The lower threshold\n\nThis page relates to step 5 of the method statement in Section 121(1) ITEPA 2003, see [EIM24015](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24015.htm). \n\nThe lower threshold is the approved CO2 emissions figure upon which all calculations of the appropriate percentage are based. The only exception, which applies to years from 2008/09 to 2011/12, is for qualifying low emissions cars (QUALECs, [EIM24605](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24605.htm)).\n\nThe lower threshold has been specified for the following tax years: \n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Tax year\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n### Lower threshold, g/km\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2003/04 \n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n155 \n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2004/05 \n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n145 \n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2005/06 to 2007/08\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n140 \n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2008/09 to 2009/10\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n135 \n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2010/11 \n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n130\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2011/12 \n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n125\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2012/13 onwards\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nSee [EIM24655](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24655.htm)&#xA0;\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThe reductions in the lower threshold reflect the fact that new cars are becoming more efficient and so the average level of CO2 emissions is falling.\n\n### Calculating the appropriate percentage from the lower threshold\n\nThe appropriate percentage is calculated as follows: \n\n*   if the car&#x2019;s CO2 emissions figure does not exceed the lower threshold for the year, the appropriate percentage is 15% (the basic percentage)\n*   if the car&#x2019;s CO2 emissions figure exceeds the lower threshold for the year, the appropriate percentage is whichever is the lesser of:\n\n*   *   the basic percentage increased by one percentage point for each 5g/km by which the CO2 emissions figure exceeds the lower threshold for the year and\n    *   35%.\n\nThere is a ready reckoner for the appropriate percentage for a petrol-powered car for the above years at [EIM24700](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24700.htm) ([EIM24705](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM24705.htm) for 2011/12). \n\nFor examples showing the calculation of the car benefit charge for petrol cars with approved CO2 emissions figures for 2002/03 to 2010/11, see [EIM25020](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM25020.htm).","sections":[]}}
