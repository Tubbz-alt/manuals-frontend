To calculate the foreign service\nreduction, the first step is find the amount charged to tax (or,\nmore accurately, the amount that would otherwise count as\nemployment income, see\n[EIM13700](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13700)), as follows:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Termination payments and\n\nbenefits within Section 401 ITEPA 2003</td><td>&#xA3;100,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Threshold (see\n\n[EIM13505](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM12800#EIM13505))</td><td>&#xA3;30,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amount charged to\n\ntax</td><td>&#xA3;70,000</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThe reduction is then calculated using the &#xA3;70,000 figure,\n\nsee example\n\n[EIM13985](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM13985).","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM12800","EIM13980"],"section_groups":[]}}
