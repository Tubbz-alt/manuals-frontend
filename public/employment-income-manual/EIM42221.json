She is resident and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom in 2005/06, and she accepts that the lump sum is taxable in full as earnings from her office as director. Accordingly, PAYE must be operated on 15 March 2005. The lump sum will be assessed in 2004/05 (the year of receipt), even though the employment does not start until 2005/06. Card 4 of the Employer's Basic Guide to PAYE still applies.\n\nAs regards the chargeability of sums paid to induce a person to take up an office or employment, see [EIM00700](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00700).\n\nIf it is contended that pre-commencement earnings cannot be attributed to a year when the job was held, see [EIM40005](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM40000#EIM40005).","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
