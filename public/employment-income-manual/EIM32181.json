At certain times of the year he has work to do over the weekend. Generally, he takes it with him to his holiday cottage in Cornwall where he goes with his family most weekends. No deduction is due for the cost of his travel between home and Cornwall.\n\nThe cottage in Cornwall is not a workplace because it is not a place at which the employee's attendance is necessary in the performance of his duties, see [EIM32055](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32000#EIM32055). Therefore the travel between home and Cornwall is private travel.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
