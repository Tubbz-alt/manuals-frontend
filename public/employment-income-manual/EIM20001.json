Some benefits, that are not\nexcluded benefits (\n[EIM20006](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20006)), are nevertheless exempt from\ncharge.\n\n### Exemptions from charge\n\nThere are two different kinds of exemption (Section 227(1) ITEPA\n2003):\n\n*   an &#x201C;earnings-only exemption&#x201D;\n(Section 227(2)) and\n*   an &#x201C;employment income\nexemption&#x201D; (Section 227(3)) that removes any charge to tax as\nemployment income of any kind.\n\n### Earnings-only exemption\n\nAn earnings-only exemption removes any charge to tax as general\nearnings. The benefits code charges income as general earnings and\n\nso an earnings-only exemption will exempt from charge any income\n\narising under the benefits code. But an earnings-only exemption\n\ndoes not necessarily exempt income from tax altogether, it may be\n\ntaxable as another form of specific employment income.\n\nFor example, Section 307 ITEPA 2003 exempts from charge as\n\nearnings under the benefits code any expense incurred by an\n\nemployer for an employee in respect of a pension, or similar\n\npayment, payable to the employee on death or retirement. However,\n\nas an earnings-only exemption, Section 307 does not prevent a\n\ncharge arising under another provision that taxes the payment as\n\nspecific employment income, rather than as general earnings (see\n\n[EIM00512](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00512)). For example, payments and\n\nbenefits on termination of employment under Part 6 Chapter 3 ITEPA\n\n2003 (\n\n[EIM15120](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM15000#EIM15120)).\n\n### Employment income exemption\n\nAn employment income exemption is much broader in effect than an\n\nearnings-only exemption. It ensures there is no possibility of\n\ncharge under any provision of the Income Tax (Earnings and\n\nPensions) Act 2003.\n\nWhere a benefit forms part of employment income because it is\n\nspecific employment income, an earnings-only exemption will not\n\nmatter when deciding whether or not the benefit is chargeable as\n\nemployment income.\n\nSee\n\n[EIM21240](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21000#EIM21240) for more information on\n\nexemptions from charge."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM20040","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20040","title":"Pensioners and former\nemployees","body":"The benefits code charges an expense payment (Section 70(1)\nITEPA 2003) or a benefit provided (Section 201(1) ITEPA 2003) to a\ndirector or employee (except one in excluded employment (\n[EIM20007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20001#EIM20007))), who holds an employment\nduring a year. It follows that no charge can arise under either\nsection in a year when there is no employment unless,\nexceptionally, the benefit or expense was arranged before the\nemployment ceased but not provided or paid until after the\nemployment ceased in a deliberate attempt to exploit the wording of\nthe statute.\n\nConsequently expenses payments made and benefits provided\nafter a director or employee has left the employment are not\nchargeable under the benefits code (\n[EIM20006](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20006)), except that two benefits are\n\nchargeable.
