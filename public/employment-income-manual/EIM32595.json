Its profits, whilst chargeable to tax in its own country, are not subject to UK tax. In that case:\n\n* there can be no disallowance on the company under Section 577 ICTA 1988 so\n* it is impossible for the employee to satisfy the conditions in Section 357 ITEPA 2003, and so avoid the disallowance under Section 356 (see [EIM32585](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM32585.htm)).\n\nThis can, and often does, result in such employees being taxed on their reimbursed entertainment expenses with no possibility of an off-setting deduction under Section 336, even though the expenses may satisfy the conditions of that section. Section 356 prevents a deduction being given.\n\nAs regards UK trading employers whose profits are exempt under the terms of a double taxation agreement, see [EIM32600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32600).","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
