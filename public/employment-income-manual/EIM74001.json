Most schemes that before 6 April 2006 paid pensions or\n\nannuities taxable under Part 9 Chapters 6 to 9 became registered\n\npension schemes on that date. With effect from 6 April 2006, all\n\npensions and annuities paid under registered pension schemes are\n\ntaxable under the rules in new Chapter 5A. Chapters 6 to 9 and\n\nChapter 13 do not apply to pension income for any tax year after\n\n2005-06. New Chapter 15A exempts certain lump sums paid under a\n\nregistered pension scheme but also provides that certain lump sums\n\nare treated as taxable pension income.\n\nSee the Registered Pension Schemes manual for detailed\n\nguidance about registered pension schemes including tax relief,\n\nallowances and member benefits.\n\n### Exempt income\n\nExempt income means pension income on which no liability to\n\nincome tax arises as a result of any of the provisions listed in\n\nPart 9 Chapters 15A to 18 ITEPA 2003. See\n\n[EIM74008](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74008) for an overview of these\n\nprovisions.\n\n### Person who is liable to tax\n\nFor each of the different categories of pension income in Part 9\n\nChapters 3 to 15A ITEPA 2003, there is a provision that identifies\n\nthe person who is liable to tax. For pensions or annuities, the\n\nperson liable to tax will be the person who receives or is entitled\n\nto the pension or annuity. Before 6 April 2006, different rules\n\napplied to unauthorised payments from approved schemes and to the\n\ncharge on the return of surplus employee additional voluntary\n\ncontributions. See\n\n[EIM74010](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74010) for guidance on who is liable\n\nto tax where entitlement to a pension is included as part of a\n\nfinancial settlement on divorce.\n\n### Amount of pension income charged to tax\n\nFor each pension or annuity, the amount charged to tax is the\n\nnet taxable pension income for the tax year. This figure is found\n\nby subtracting any deductions (see\n\n[EIM74201](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74201)) allowed from pension income\n\nfrom the taxable pension income. The amount of taxable pension\n\nincome is determined by reference to the relevant Chapter of ITEPA\n\n2003 that applies to the pension or annuity in question. See\n\n[EIM74101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74101) for details of how to find the\n\namount of taxable pension income for each category.\n\n### PAYE and deduction of tax\n\nMany pensions and annuities are subject to deduction of tax\n\nunder PAYE or otherwise. See\n\n[EIM74261](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74261) for details.\n\n### Procedural matters\n\nAs regards procedural matters relating to pensioners see the\n\nPAYE Operation area of the PAYE Manual.","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM74000","EIM74001"],"section_groups":[]}}
