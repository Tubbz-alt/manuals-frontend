SED may be claimed only against these earnings.\n\nEEA States comprise all of those States that are members of the European Union plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.\n\nSee [EIM33010](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33010) for details regarding a claim to seafarers&#x2019; earnings deduction from a non-UK resident seafarer.\n\n### Salvage payments\n\nSee [EIM70220](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM70199#EIM70220) for details relating to salvage awards.\n\nIf the award is payable by the employer to the employee it represents part of the employee&#x2019;s earnings from his employment and is taxable under Section 62 ITEPA 2003 as general earnings ([EIM00600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00600)).\n\nIf the award is payable by a third party to the employee, it may still form part of earnings within Section 62.  It will depend on the facts.  But even if it is not taxable under Section 62, it is very likely to be taxable as a cash benefit under Section 201 ITEPA 2003 as in most circumstances the payment will arise &#x201C;by reason of&#x201D; employment ([EIM20503](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20500#EIM20503)) even if paid by a third party.\n\n### Share option gains\n\nSeafarers&#x2019; earnings deduction is not available as a deduction to be set against gains made on the exercise of a share option.  Such gains are taxable under the rules on Securities Options in Chapter 5 of Part 7 (section 471 onwards) ITEPA 2003.    See ERSM110100.\n\nSeafarers&#x2019; earnings deduction is available only against &#x201C;general earnings&#x201D; as defined in Section 7(3) ITEPA - see [EIM00510](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00510).  The gain on exercise of a share option does not fall within the definition of general earnings.   Rather income chargeable under Part 7 of ITEPA is defined as &#x201C;specific employment income&#x201D; under Section 7(4) ITEPA.\n\n### Deduction not exemption\n\nSection 378 provides for a deduction from a seafarer's earnings in order to calculate the net taxable earnings from employment. It does not exempt the earnings from tax.\n\n### More than one employment\n\nIf a seafarer has more than one seafaring employment in a tax year, he must meet the conditions for seafarers&#x2019; earnings deduction for each employment separately.  For example, he will require a voyage to at least one foreign port in each employment in order to qualify for seafarers&#x2019; earnings deduction ([EIM33031](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33031)).\n\n### National Insurance\n\nThe deduction applies for tax purposes only.  For information about seafarers&#x2019; liability to National Insurance Contributions (NICs), see NIM29002 onwards.

This does not affect the amount of the deduction.\nIt is not necessary to separate out or apportion earnings arising\nfrom the United Kingdom and from abroad. Section 379 specifies that\nall earnings attributable to the eligible period attract the\ndeduction irrespective of where they arose.\n\n Section 381 ITEPA 2003 lists the deductions that should be\nsubtracted first.

If a\nseafarer leaves the United Kingdom to work abroad and at least 365\ndays later returns, an eligible period is achieved.\n\n### Combined period (made up of days abroad and days inside the\nUnited Kingdom)\n\nSection 378(3) permits an eligible period to be built up by\nadding together days spent abroad and days spent in the United\nKingdom. A combined period is a period:\n\n*   at least half the days in which are days\n\n    of absence from the United Kingdom and\n*   which consists of three consecutive\n\n    periods, A, B and C, where:\n\n*   A is a period of consecutive days of absence from\n\n    the United Kingdom or a period which is itself a combined\n\n    period\n*   B is a period of not more than 183 days and\n*   C is a period of consecutive days of absence from\n\n    the United Kingdom.\n\n### What is a day of absence from the United Kingdom?\n\nA day of absence is a day at the end of which the employee is\n\nabsent from the United Kingdom. The end of a day for this purpose\n\nis midnight, see Section 378(4) and the case of Hoye v Forsdyke\n\n(55TC281). In general terms, a day of departure counts as a day of\n\nabsence and the day of return does not. For more details see\n\n[EIM33007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33007).\n\n### Periods of non residence in the United Kingdom\n\nPeriods when an individual is non-resident may not be included\n\nin an eligible period.

In\nthe simplest case there may have been two periods of absence from\nthe United Kingdom broken by days spent in the United Kingdom. The\nfirst period of absence (A) and the second period of absence (C)\nmay be combined provided that the period between the two (B) is not\nmore than 183 days. Periods A, B and C will together comprise a\ncombined period provided that at least half of the days in that\nperiod are days of absence from the United Kingdom. An eligible\n\nperiod will be achieved once the total days in the combined period\n\nare 365 or more.\n\n Where there are less than 365 days in a combined period,\n\nthat period may itself be combined with a further period of days of\n\nabsence from the United Kingdom. The existing combined period (A)\n\ncan be combined with a further period of absence (C) provided that\n\nthe period between the two (B) is not more than 183 days. A new\n\ncombined period will result if at least half of the days in the new\n\nperiod (total days in periods A, B and C) are days of absence from\n\nthe United Kingdom. An eligible period will be achieved once the\n\ntotal days in the new combined period are 365 or more.\n\n### Starting the calculation again\n\nAt any point in the cumulative calculation of a combined period,\n\none of the following tests may be failed:\n\n*   the period between two periods of absence\n\n    from the United Kingdom or the period between a combined period and\n\n    the latest period of absence (period B) exceeds 183 days. In short,\n\n    the cumulative calculation is broken as soon as more than 183\n\n    consecutive days are spent in the United Kingdom.\n*   more than half of the total number of days\n\n    in the consecutive periods (A, B and C) are days spent in the\n\n    United Kingdom.\n\nAs soon as one of these tests is failed, then a new calculation\n\nis required starting from the last period of absence from the\n\nUnited Kingdom. The cumulative process will begin again in order to\n\nestablish an eligible period consisting of either 365 consecutive\n\ndays of absence or a combined period of 365 days. The process may\n\ncontinue beyond 365 days to establish an eligible period of much\n\ngreater length. It is not necessary to begin a new calculation once\n\nan eligible period has been identified.\n\n The example in\n\n[EIM33006](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33006) shows how the process works in\n\npractice. It also shows how to record periods of absence in order\n\nto apply the tests. If a period of non-residence in the UK is\n\nclaimed to be part or all of a qualifying period, see\n\n[EIM33061](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33061).\n\n### Ordinarily resident or not-resident?\n\nSeafarers who establish eligible periods significantly in excess\n\nof 365 days and who regularly spend 9 months or more out of the\n\nUnited Kingdom may be non-resident.

It does not matter whether work has been carried out on that day or not.  Similarly, it is not necessary for duties of the employment to be performed during each and every period of absence. See [EIM33031](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33031) for guidance on the meaning of &#x201C;duties performed wholly or partly outside the United Kingdom&#x201D;.\n\n### Example\n\nA seafarer who has been working abroad for 330 days who returns to the United Kingdom for 30 days and then goes abroad again for a 7 day holiday will have an eligible period of at least 365 days.\n\n### Voyages beginning or ending in the UK or outside the UK\n\nThe question where a voyage begins and ends must be one of fact.   For the purposes of calculating days of absence for an eligible period a person shall not be regarded as absent from the UK on any day unless he is absent at the end of it - at midnight.   For this purpose, the casting off from a UK berth (**if allied to passage to an overseas port**) is taken as the time of departure from the UK, and equally a ship would be regarded as arriving in the UK at the time of berthing.\n\nBut if the voyage is between UK ports, the day of absence is not determined by the time of leaving or arriving at its berth.  Rather it is determined by the ship&#x2019;s position at midnight.\n\nSome items of guidance were published during the 1980's and 1990's which stated that voyages between UK ports were subject to the same concession as if the journey were allied to passage to an overseas port.  These publications include form P84 and the booklet \"Seafarers - Notes on Claims to 100% Foreign Earnings Deductions\" (also known as the Blue Book).  With effect from 14 February 2014 any publication containing such guidance must not be used in the preparation of a claim to Seafarer's Earnings Deduction.\n\n### The merely incidental duties concept does not apply to days of absence\n\nFor the purposes of calculating an eligible period, presence in, or absence from, the United Kingdom is a question of fact. If on a particular day an employee is in the United Kingdom performing duties that are merely incidental to the work he or she does abroad, that day is treated as what it is, namely, a day spent in the United Kingdom.

For example, claims for a refund of tax fro 2007/08 must be made on or before 5 April 2012.  If a claim is made on or after 6 April 2012 and before 6 April 2013, the earliest year in respect of which a seafarer would be able to claim a refund of tax is 2008/09.\n\nThus the statutory time limits require any seafarer who wishes to make a claim for a refund of tax for the tax year 2007/08 to submit the claim to HMRC by 5 April 2012.\n\nHowever as HMRC only announced in March 2012 that it would accept claims for a repayment if tax if all the relevant conditions were satisfied, using its collection and management powers, it has decided to extend the deadline for accepting claims for the 07/08 tax year to 31 July 2012. If a seafarer in self-assessment therefore wishes to make a claim for a refund of tax for the tax year 2007/08, he or she must ensure the claim is made by 31 July 2012. All other statutory time limits remain unchanged.\n\n### Seafarers not in Self Assessment\n\nTransitional rules to the new time limits introduced in April 2010, allow taxpayers who wish to claim a repayment but were not within SA in the relevant tax year, more time than those in SA.\n\nNon SA taxpayers (and those in SA who were not given notice to file a return within one year of the end of the year of assessment) have until 31 March 2012 to make a claim for relief for overpaid tax in 2006/07 and until 5 April 2012 to make a claim for relief for overpaid tax in 2007/08.\n\nAgain, as HMRC only announced in March 2012 that it would accept claims for a repayment for tax if all relevant conditions were satisfied, it has decided to exercise its collection and management powers and extend the deadline for accepting such claims to 31 July 2012. A seafarer not in self-assessment who therefore wishes to make a claim for a refund for tax for the tax year 2006/07 and 2007/08 has until 31 July 2012 to submit his or her claim. All other statutory time limits remain unchanged.

You need first to identify the\nyear that the earnings are for; put another way, the year in which\nthey were earned. If in the earnings year the earnings attracted\nthe deduction then the deduction tracks through to the year the\nearnings are received if it is different.\n\n In the case of seafarers who earn and receive their earnings\nin the same tax year the position is straightforward.

It does not matter if some of the duties are not performed on board ship so long as they are incidental to those that are.\n\n### Meaning of ship\n\nThere is no statutory definition of the word ship. The Court of Appeal decided in the case of Perks v Clark and others (74TC187) that for the purposes of the deduction a ship must be:\n\n*   capable of navigation and\n*   used in navigation.\n\nNavigation means ordered movement across the water. To be a ship, a vessel does not need to have a rudder or its own motive power.\n\nStructures that do not normally move about are not generally regarded as ships as they are not used in navigation.

The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) publish these regulations.\n\nFrom 6 April 2004, the definition of offshore installation was in Section 837C ICTA 1988.  From 6 April 2007, the definition can be found in Section 1001 ITA 2007.  See [EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103) for guidance for tax years 2004-05 onwards.\n\n### Definition of offshore installation\n\nThe 1995 HSE Regulations describe offshore installations by reference to activities carried out. These activities are:\n\n*   exploring for, or exploiting, mineral resources by means of a well\n*   storing gas and recovering the stored gas\n*   where the main use is to provide accommodation for workers on offshore installations.\n\n[EIM33104](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33104) identifies different categories of vessel and structure used in the offshore oil and gas industry and indicates whether they are ships or offshore installations for the purposes of the deduction.\n\n### Territorial limitation\n\nFor the purposes of the HSE Regulations a structure is only treated as an offshore installation while it is operating in the UK sector of the continental shelf. Section 385 overrides this territorial limitation so structures engaged in these activities anywhere in the world should not be accepted as ships for the purposes of the deduction.\n\nFor example, an employee who works on an offshore installation drilling off the coast of West Africa does not perform duties on a ship, is not a seafarer and is not entitled to the deduction.\n\n### Offshore installations in transit\n\nThe HSE apply health and safety rules appropriate to ships to offshore installations in transit. However, installations in transit, whether towed or self-propelled, remain within the definition of offshore installation in the 1995 Regulations. Employees working on offshore installations that are being moved are not seafarers for the purposes of the deduction.\n\n### Changes in use\n\nAn offshore installation may cease to be used for one of the specified activities in the 1995 Regulations and be used for another purpose. It will remain an offshore installation unless the change is permanent and there is no intention to undertake any of the specified activities again.\n\nMobile installations such as mobile drilling rigs may be taken out of use for relatively extensive periods, for example, when work is not available. Such installations will cease to be offshore installations until they are ready and preparing to depart for a new working station. An employee may claim that he or she is a seafarer when working on a mobile installation that has been taken out of use. The facts should be carefully considered in each case. Little or no use in navigation in the relevant year may mean that the installation will not be a ship on first principles (see [EIM33101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33101)).\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33103","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33103","title":"Meaning of offshore installation: 2004/05 onwards","body":"### Section 385 ITEPA 2003 and Section 1001 ITA 2007\n\nSeafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED) is available to a &#x201C;seafarer&#x201D; who performs duties of employment on a &#x201C;ship&#x201D; if various conditions are satisfied ([EIM33101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33101)).\n\nFrom 6 April 2007 Section 1001 ITA 2007 provides a free-standing definition of offshore installation for the purposes of the Taxes Acts including SED.

A relevant use is use for -\n\n*   exploiting mineral resources by means of a well;*   exploration with a view to exploiting mineral resources by means of a well;*   storage of gas in or under the shore or the bed of any waters;*   recovery of gas so stored;*   conveyance of things by means of a pipe;*   mainly for the provision of accommodation for persons who work on or from a structure which is, is to be, or has been, put to a use specified above\n\n[EIM33104](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33104) lists different categories of vessel and structure used in the offshore oil and gas industry and indicates whether they are regarded as ships or offshore installations for the purposes of SED.\n\n### Changes in use\n\nSection 1001(2) provides that a structure is not an offshore installation if -\n\n*   it has ceased permanently to be put to a relevant use,*   it is not, and is not to be, put to any other relevant use, and*   since ceasing permanently to be put to a relevant use, it has been put to a use which is not relevant.\n\nThe effect of this provision is that a structure that satisfies the definition of offshore installation will remain within the definition unless it has **permanently**&#xA0;**ceased** to be used as an offshore installation with no prospect of resuming such use **and** it has been put to an entirely new use.\n\nPermanent cessation requires a cessation of use that is both lasting (i.e. not merely temporary) and is combined with the lack of a fixed intention to use the vessels in such a manner again.  This should be a straightforward question of fact.  The term does **not** require\n\n*   either that there is an intention for the vessel never to be used again in a particular manner, or\n*   that the vessel be rendered physically incapable of such use ever again as a result of a refit or refurbishment.\n\nSee [EIM33107](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33107) for vessels designed to be capable of more than one use.\n\n### Example\n\nThe following example illustrates how the legislation works.  On 6 April 2007, a mobile drilling rig in port in Rotterdam obtained a contract for work in the Dutch sector of the North Sea from 1 May.  It left Rotterdam on 30 April and carried out exploration drilling for gas until 31 July.  On completion of its contract, it returned to Rotterdam and remained idle until 31 December.  On 1 January 2008, it obtained a new drilling contract in the Gulf of Mexico and left Rotterdam on 1 February arriving in Mexican waters on 28 February where it drilled for oil between 1 March and 5 April.\n\nThe rig was an offshore installation throughout 2007-08.  At any one time, it was either in use, to be used or it had been used for &#x201C;exploration with a view to exploiting mineral resources by means of a well&#x201D;.  This includes all periods in transit between locations and the periods when the rig was not used.  Therefore, earnings attributable to any duties performed on the rig in 2007-08 are not eligible for SED.\n\n### Definition of offshore installation before 6 April 2007 - Section 837C ICTA 1988\n\nThe definition of an offshore installation in section 837C ICTA 1988 which applied until 5 April 2007 had the same effect as section 1001 ITA 2007.  The only significant difference in wording was the reference to a &#x201C;specified&#x201D; use in section 837C instead of a &#x201C;relevant&#x201D; use in section 1001.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33104","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33104","title":"Offshore installations and ships: up to and including 2007/08: examples","body":"For years up to and including 2007/08, HMRC published the lists below of vessels that were classed either as an offshore installation or as a ship.

Where a vessel is designed to have dual or multiple uses see [EIM33107](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33107).\n\nThe definition of an offshore installation requires, firstly, a vessel to perform a &#x201C;relevant use&#x201D; ([EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)) whilst, secondly, it is &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; in any waters (see [EIM33108](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33108)).  Both legs of the definition must be satisfied to classify a vessel as an offshore installation. If a vessel performs a relevant use in a transient manner (i.e. whilst not standing or stationed) the second leg of this definition is not satisfied.  It follows that if a vessel capable of (and actually undergoing) movement across water is not an offshore installation, it must be a ship for the purposes of SED.\n\nWhile some structures are clearly identifiable as offshore installations and others as ships, there are some structures that are more difficult to categorise as one or the other.\n\n**Consequently whether a vessel is an offshore installation or a ship depends on the facts of each case. **\n\n### Vessels working in the offshore oil and gas industry that are offshore installations\n\nThe following structures are offshore installations and are not accepted as ships for the purposes of Seafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED):\n\n*   floating production platforms\n*   floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs)\n*   floating storage units (FSUs)\n*   mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) including drillships, semi-submersible and jack-up rigs and tension leg platforms\n*   flotels (floating accommodation units).\n\n### Vessels working in the offshore oil and gas industry that may be accepted as ships\n\nThe following vessels may be accepted as ships for the purposes of SED if they satisfy the general conditions described at [EIM33101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33101) and they perform their duties whilst not standing or stationed (EIM33108):\n\n*   anchor handling vessels*   construction and maintenance vessels\n*   diving support vessels\n*   heavy lifting vessels*   pipe laying barges\n*   platform support vessels\n*   safety standby vessels\n*   seismic survey vessels\n*   shuttle tankers\n*   well service vessels\n\nBut if one of these vessels is engaged in a relevant use (EIM33103), whilst standing or stationed (EIM33108), it will be classed as an offshore installation.\n\n### 2008/09 onwards\n\nFor 2008/09 onwards, the decisions in Torr and Others v CIR (EIM33111) and Spowage and Others v CIR (EIM33112) must be taken into account when deciding whether a vessel is an offshore installation or a ship.

The lists were for illustrative purposes only - they were not intended to be comprehensive lists of all the vessels in one category or the other.\n\nFor 2008/09 onwards, the lists remain relevant but the implications of the decisions in Torr and Others v CIR ([EIM33111](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33111)) and Spowage and Others v CIR ([EIM33112](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33112)) must be taken into account as well.  See below for further information.\n\n### Section 1001 ITA 2007\n\nFollowing the decision in Torr and Others v CIR (EIM33111) published in January 2008, for 2008/09 onwards HMRC issued revised guidance explaining its interpretation of the distinction between a ship and an offshore installation.\n\nHowever, following a more recent decision in Spowage and Others v CIR (EIM33112) published in June 2009, HMRC has undertaken a further review and has revised its guidance again.   This replaces the earlier guidance published after the Torr decision and applies for 2008/09 onwards.\n\nBefore the Torr and Spowage decisions, HMRC regarded certain types of vessels as ships for the purpose of SED (EIM33104) because it understood these vessels always performed their duties in a transient manner (see [EIM33108](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33108)).  The following are examples of the vessels concerned:\n\n*   diving support vessels (DSVs)\n*   heavy lifting and construction vessels\n*   well service vessels (WSVs).\n\nFor 2008/09 onwards, the decisions in Torr and Spowage require this classification based simply on vessel type to be reconsidered.   It is no longer possible to class a vessel as either an offshore installation or as a ship, based solely on the vessel type or description.\n\nIt is necessary to consider the nature of the duties performed by the vessel.  For instance, while a diving support vessel is likely in most circumstances to be classed as a ship, in circumstances where it carries out tasks like those of the PSA in Torr (EIM33111), it could be classed as an offshore installation.   Which definition applies depends on the facts of each case.\n\n### The effect of the decision in Torr\n\nThe PSA performed its duties entirely as a well workover and support vessel.  The Special Commissioner found that the services carried out by the PSA constituted a relevant use ([EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)) and that the PSA performed its duties whilst standing or stationed in any waters (EIM33108).  Consequently the PSA was an offshore installation.\n\nFor 2008/09 onwards, based on the decision in Torr, a support vessel engaged in exploiting mineral resources by means of a well **whilst standing or stationed, would be classified as an offshore installation**.  For example, this could apply to DSVs, heavy lifting/construction vessels and WSVs because repair duties were regarded in Torr as part of the process of exploiting mineral resources by means of a well and therefore qualified as a relevant use (EIM33103).\n\nHowever, if these vessels do not perform those duties whilst standing or stationed, they remain outside the definition of an offshore installation (EIM33108).  Nonetheless some support vessels do perform duties while standing or stationed and, after PSA, these are classed as offshore installations instead of ships.\n\nSome of the same principles considered in Torr were subsequently considered again in Spowage.  Consequently the Torr decision cannot be applied in isolation.  It must be considered in light of the later decision in Spowage and the common principles that emerge from both cases considered together (see [EIM33106](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33106)).\n\n### The effect of the decision in Spowage\n\nThe Spowage decision, which was published approximately 18 months after Torr, restricts the circumstances in which a support vessel engaged in construction and maintenance activity can be regarded as performing a relevant use.\n\nThe Judge in the First-Tier Tribunal found that the three vessels owned by Prosafe performed a range of construction and maintenance duties in support of one or more production platforms.  The Judge likened the Prosafe vessels to &#x201C;floating toolboxes&#x201D;. Also he found that the tasks they performed (e.g. fabrication, construction and maintenance work carried out on the Prosafe vessels before the plant/equipment was moved subsequently by crane or vessel to be installed elsewhere) were performed &#x201C;remote from actual oil extraction and/or processing&#x201D;.\n\n### 2008/09 onwards - the meaning of &#x201C;exploiting mineral resources by means of a well&#x201D;\n\nConsequently the wide definition of &#x201C;exploiting mineral resources by means of a well&#x201D; that arose from the decision in Torr, is partly restricted by the narrower definition of that term applied in the more recent decision in Spowage.\n\nFor 2008/09 onwards, the implications of the decisions in Torr and Spowage apply together and must be considered to determine whether a vessel is an offshore installation or a ship.

For 2008/09 onwards, the decisions in two cases issued in January 2008 (Torr) and June 2009 (Spowage) are directly relevant to the classification of a vessel as either an offshore installation or a ship (see [EIM33105](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33105) and [EIM33106](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33106)).\n\n### 2008/09 onwards - the meaning of &#x201C;exploiting mineral resources by means of a well&#x201D;\n\nThe Tribunal Judge in Spowage ([EIM33112](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33112)) distinguished the construction and maintenance duties carried out by the Prosafe vessels, from the activities performed by the PSA in Torr ([EIM33111](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33111)).\n\nWhereas the PSA&#x2019;s activities were closely associated in a physical sense with the production of oil at the well-head (e.g. working down the well, pumping heavy liquid into the well, repair/replacement of Xmas trees over wellheads and construction of manifolds to connect pipelines), the Prosafe vessels carried out construction and maintenance duties &#x201C;remote&#x201D; from the production process.\n\nThe Tribunal Judge decided that while &#x201C;exploiting mineral resources by means of a well&#x201D; (EIM33103) extends to duties performed by a vessel in association with extraction, storage and processing of oil and gas, it does not extend to repair and maintenance duties performed away from the well-head.    These duties cannot be part of the process of exploiting mineral resources &#x201D;by means of a well&#x201D;, if they are performed away from the well.\n\nAccordingly for 2008/09 onwards when considering whether a support vessel such as a diving support vessel (DSV), a construction vessel or a well service vessel (WSV) should be classed for SED as an offshore installation or a ship, one must take into account the nature of the duties that it performs.   If one of these vessels performs its duties while not closely associated with the production process (e.g. away from the well-head and/or associated sub-sea equipment) it is not involved in exploiting mineral resources by means of a well.  It follows that it is not performing a relevant use (unless it satisfies one of the alternative definitions of that term - EIM33103) and that it is not an offshore installation.\n\nOn the other hand, if one of these vessels carries out duties like the PSA in Torr, which are  closely associated with the production process (e.g. at or near the well-head and/or associated subsea equipment), those duties are part of the process of exploiting mineral resources by means of a well.  It follows that the vessel will be an offshore installation, as long as it is standing or stationed ([EIM33108](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33108)) while it performs those duties.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33107","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33107","title":"Dual or multi-use vessels","body":"## Section 1001 (3) ITA 2007\n\nFor the purposes of a claim to Seafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED), a seafarer must perform duties of an employment on a ship.   The definition of a ship excludes an offshore installation.\n\nAn offshore installation is defined primarily in respect of the relevant use that the structure performs ([EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)), although it must also perform the relevant use whilst &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; in any waters (see [EIM33108](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33108)).\n\n### Single use vessels\n\nIn Perks v Clark and Others (74TC187), Carnwath, J. decided that the classification of a vessel as a ship or not, should be based on the original design of the vessel and not its use at any time:\n\n&#x201C;&#x2026; the categorisation of a structure, as a ship or not, should be governed by its design and capability, rather than its actual use at any time&#x2026;&#x201D;.\n\nWhere a vessel is designed to operate for one purpose it should be straightforward to determine whether it should be classed as an offshore installation or as a ship.\n\nOnce a structure is classed as an offshore installation, it remains an offshore installation unless it ceases permanently to be put to that use (EIM33103).\n\n### Dual or multi-use vessels\n\nHowever, it is common for vessels to be designed to perform two or more types of duties.  Where one of those activities relates to a relevant use (EIM33103) which would classify the vessel as an offshore installation and another to an activity which is not a relevant use, which would not classify the vessel an offshore installation, and the two uses are of similar importance, Carnwath&#x2019;s comments do not help to determine the status of the vessel.\n\nIn these circumstances it is reasonable to consider the different types of use of the vessel during the period concerned.  If there is a principal use and the other use(s) is/ are less significant, it is reasonable to determine the classification of the vessel according to the principal use.\n\nIf it is impossible on initial examination to distinguish in importance between two or more uses, you should seek details of the nature of the operations performed by the vessel in the tax year and adopt a fair and reasonable approach to determine how to classify the vessel.\n\n### Change of use\n\nOn first principles, the purpose for which a vessel is intended to be used determines its classification as an offshore installation or a ship - see the comments above of Carnwath, J. in Clark v Perks.   But a permanent change in use may change the classification of a vessel (EIM33103).\n\nStrictly if a vessel is designed to perform a relevant use, but it is put to use subsequently for a purpose which is not a relevant use, the vessel remains an offshore installation unless the original design use has ceased permanently to be possible for this vessel (e.g. the vessel is no longer capable of performing activities for the purpose for which it was designed as a result of a refurbishment or substantial refit).   This point was considered in CIR v Langley (see [EIM33110](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33110)).\n\nThis may seem unreasonable where the vessel has not been used at all for its original design purpose, or this has not been its principal use, during a tax year.  In these circumstances you should apply a fair and reasonable approach to determine the status of the vessel depending on the facts of each case.  If its sole (or principal) use during a tax year was not a relevant use, it is reasonable to classify the vessel according to its use in the year and not according to its original design specification.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33108","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33108","title":"Standing or stationed: dynamic positioning","body":"\n\n## Section 1001(4)(a) and (b) ITA 2007\n\nFor the purposes of a claim to Seafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED), an individual must perform duties of an employment on a ship.  The definition of a ship excludes an offshore installation (see [EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)).\n\nAn offshore installation is defined primarily in respect of the relevant use ([EIM33107](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33107)) that it performs, but the structure must also be put to that use whilst &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; in any waters (EIM33103) in order for it to be classed as an offshore installation.  If a vessel does not satisfy **both** of these conditions it is not an offshore installation and, as long as it is capable of movement across water, it is a ship for the purposes of SED.\n\n### The meaning of &#x201C;standing&#x201D; or &#x201C;stationed&#x201D; in any waters\n\nIn Torr and Others v CIR (see [EIM33111](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33111)), one of the appellants&#x2019; arguments relied on the suggestion that the Pride South America (PSA) was not an offshore installation because it was neither standing nor stationed when carrying out its well workover and support duties.\n\nThe appellants relied on the fact that as the PSA operated in deep water it was not possible to fix the vessel to the sea floor by anchor or hawser.  Instead it used dynamic positioning (DP) to maintain its position over a well whilst performing its operations.\n\nThe Special Commissioner dismissed this contention as follows -\n\n&#x201C;I have no hesitation in deciding that the use was while standing or stationed.  The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary gives the following meaning for &#x201C;station&#x201D;: &#x201C;1. assign a post, position or station to (a person, troops, ship, etc); place, post.  2. To take up one&#x2019;s position, post oneself.&#x201D;  It would be absurd to suggest that a ship can only be stationed if it is either secured by anchors or hawsers.  A ship can be stationed in deep water.  While the context in which the word &#x201C;stationed&#x201D; is used is as an alternative to &#x201C;standing&#x201D;, the word clearly envisages the ship being substantially stationary, I am satisfied that when dynamically positioned the Pride South America was stationed.&#x201D;\n\nHMRC takes a broad view of the meaning of &#x201C;stationed&#x201D;.  For example, whilst working in support of an offshore structure, a vessel may move off from the structure and then back to it, or move around from one side of the structure to another, for weather or operational reasons.  Despite these movements, if the vessel continues to perform duties in support of that structure it is regarded at all times as stationed, in the sense of being on station at that structure.\n\nThis interpretation was confirmed by the Upper Tribunal in Gouldson v HMRC (UKUT238 (TCC)) a decision published in June 2011 in which the Tribunal Judges decided that:\n\n&#x201C;&#x2026; &#x201C;stationed&#x201D; does not require a vessel to be fixed rigidly in one immoveable position, but allows of minor movement in relation to a fixed point.&#x201D;\n\nAnd the term stationed may be of wider application, if there are two or more structures forming part of an integrated complex.  If a vessel moves between these structures in the one complex or station to perform duties at different structures within the one complex, in HMRC&#x2019;s view the vessel is stationed (on station) within that complex.\n\n### Dynamic positioning\n\nIt follows from this decision that a vessel which is substantially stationary because of DP satisfies the requirement to be &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; in the definition of an offshore installation.  Of course a vessel positioned by DP may be subject to some lateral and vertical motion in the water but that is no different from a vessel secured by hawser or anchor.\n\nHowever, a vessel may use DP when it is underway to maintain a compass heading that may not be in the direction of vessel motion.  In these circumstances the DP helps the vessel maintain its progress and navigation but the DP is not intended to keep the vessel substantially stationed.\n\nIn other circumstances, DP may be used to maintain a vessel&#x2019;s position on station (e.g. over a well), which may include some lateral movement, but subject to the length of time that the vessel is stationed in this way ([EIM33109](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33109)), HMRC may regard a vessel in this situation as &#x201C;stationed&#x201D; within the definition of an offshore installation.  This may include movement of position around an offshore installation by a vessel that is providing services or supplies to that installation.\n\nSee EIM33109 for guidance regarding the length of time that a vessel must spend &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; to satisfy this leg of the definition of an offshore installation.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33109","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33109","title":"Standing or stationed: duration of stay at work location","body":"## Section 1001(4)(a) and (b) ITA 2007\n\nFor the purposes of a claim to Seafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED), an individual must perform duties of an employment on a ship.  The definition of a ship excludes an offshore installation (see [EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)).\n\nTo be an offshore installation a vessel must perform a relevant use (EIM33103) whilst &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; in any waters ([EIM33108](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33108)).\n\n### How long does a vessel need to be standing or stationed\n\nA vessel which provides supplies to an offshore drilling rig will need to be standing and/or stationed for a period whilst it offloads those supplies.  HMRC would not normally regard a stay of short duration whilst unloading supplies as falling within the statutory definition of standing or stationed in any waters, which implies a longer period of time without significant movement.\n\nThe definition of an offshore installation derives from rules found previously in Health and Safety Executive (HSE) legislation in the 1990s.  When applying that legislation there was a rule of thumb sometimes used that a vessel standing or stationed for more than three days was regarded as &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; for the purpose of the definition of an offshore installation, whereas a vessel that was standing or stationed for three days or less did not satisfy the definition.  In a small number of cases this rule of thumb was used in claims to SED.\n\nIt has been suggested to HMRC that this rule of thumb could be used in borderline cases to assist in deciding whether a vessel performed its duties whilst &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D;.  **As this is not a statutory rule, its application has no legal basis and cannot be used to determine a case one way or another** but HMRC accepts that as a broad guide it may be helpful in some borderline cases.\n\nIt has been suggested also that a rule of thumb based on three days is not always sufficient.  For example, a vessel&#x2019;s operations may be delayed for a couple of days due to bad weather, or when working in deep water it may take as long as one day to lower the necessary equipment to the sea floor before work can begin and another day to bring the equipment back to the surface, leaving only one day for the work to be carried out on the sea floor.  Also imposition of very tight timetables may compromise safety which is of paramount concern in the seafaring industry.\n\nConsequently **for 2008/09 onwards** HMRC will accept, **as a rule of thumb only**, that a vessel that spends five or fewer days at one location, should not be regarded for the purpose of the definition of an offshore installation as performing its duties whilst standing or stationed.  On the other hand, a vessel that spends more than five days at one location should be regarded as standing or stationed.\n\nEach case will depend on its facts and HMRC will apply this wholly non-statutory rule in a fair and reasonable manner.  For example, if a vessel was due to perform a task planned to take four days stationed but exceptional weather conditions forced operations to be postponed for two days in the middle of the job, so that the vessel spent six days stationed to complete the task, HMRC may be prepared to accept that the five day rule still applies.\n\n### Vessels in transit\n\nIn CIR v Langley (see [EIM33111](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33111)) it was held that when a vessel classified as an offshore installation transits to its next work location, it continues to be regarded as an offshore installation during the time spent in transit unless it has ceased permanently to be put to a relevant use.\n\nThis decision confirmed HMRC&#x2019;s view of vessel classification for time spent in transit - see [EIM33102](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33102).\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33110","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33110","title":"Offshore installations and ships: CIR v Langley","body":"### Section 1001 ITA 2007\n\nTwo Special Commissioners&#x2019; decisions published in late 2007 and early 2008 and a decision of the First-Tier Tribunal (Tax) published in June 2009, provide useful guidance in relation to the meaning of &#x201C;offshore installation&#x201D; in the context of Seafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED).

In that period the rig was constructed in a shipyard in France and subsequently underwent sea trials, before moving to its first working site off Egypt, where it commenced a period of drilling for oil.  Finally it was renovated whilst there was no immediate contract for further drilling.\n\nThe appellant argued that once the vessel was floated from the dry dock in the shipyard it became a ship, as it was capable of navigation (it could not power itself at this point).  The appellant also contended that this status continued throughout its sea trials and when it was in transit to its first drilling site.   Once drilling commenced the appellant accepted that it became an offshore installation.\n\nThe Special Commissioner decided that the rig was a structure which was to be used while standing in any waters for the purpose of exploitation of mineral resources by means of a well.  As its sole use once in operation was to perform a relevant use (see [EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)) it was intended to be put to this use from the outset of its construction.  Consequently the vessel was an offshore installation, and therefore precluded from being a ship, for the entire period of its construction, sea trials, transit to drilling site and drilling operations, until it was taken out of use for refurbishment.\n\nDuring the refit it was not put to a relevant use and, as it was otherwise capable of movement across water, it became a ship for the purposes of SED.

In the period concerned in the appeals the PSA had been involved only in well workover and support operations.  It had not carried out any drilling operations.\n\nLloyd&#x2019;s Register of Shipping defines a &#x201C;workover&#x201D; vessel as a vessel that worked over a well to install, refurbish and perform sub-sea completion work on wells but could not enter the well for extraction purposes.  A &#x201C;support vessel&#x201D; is defined as one involved in operations other than workover, such as diving, crane operations, heavy lifts and construction.\n\nIn broad terms, the Special Commissioner found that the activities of the PSA could be described as the repair of non functioning equipment.  A well had to be killed (temporarily shut down) when the PSA carried out its operations.  In the years under appeal, the PSA carried out its workover and support operations at between 18 - 26 different locations in each year.\n\nThe appellants put forward two principal contentions to demonstrate that the PSA was not an offshore installation ([EIM33102](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33102)) and, as it was capable of movement across water ([EIM33101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33101)), it must therefore be a ship -\n\n*   the PSA was not involved in the exploitation of mineral resources by means of a well as it did not extract oil from below the sea bed because when it performed its operations the well had to be temporarily shut down, and\n*   when the PSA performed its operations it was not standing or stationed because it was not wholly static or anchored - it was held in place by dynamic positioning which allowed for some limited movement.\n\nThe Special Commissioner held on the first point that mineral resources do not cease to be exploited when a well has to be temporarily shut down for repairs.  The well workover and support operations formed part of the process of exploiting mineral resources.\n\nOn the second point, the Special Commissioner held that it was &#x201C;absurd&#x201D; to suggest a vessel can be stationed only by anchors or hawsers, neither of which can be used in deep waters.  He found that a vessel can be clearly &#x201C;stationed&#x201D; in deep waters if held in position by dynamic positioning, which at least has the effect of making the ship &#x201C;substantially stationary&#x201D;, which is sufficient to meet the statutory definition of &#x201C;standing or stationed&#x201D; for an offshore installation.\n\nConsequently as the PSA was involved in exploitation of mineral resources by means of a well whilst standing or stationed in any waters, the Special Commissioner held that the PSA was an offshore installation.  As it was not a ship the claims to SED failed.  The decision was not appealed."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM33112","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33112","title":"Offshore installations and ships: Spowage and Others v CIR (Prosafe vessels)","body":"## Section 1001 ITA 2007\n\nTwo Special Commissioners&#x2019; decisions published in late 2007 and early 2008 and a decision of the First-Tier Tribunal (Tax) published in June 2009 provide useful guidance relating to the meaning of &#x201C;offshore installation&#x201D; in the context of Seafarers&#x2019; Earnings Deduction (SED).

All three vessels had been designed in the early 1980s as semi-submersible accommodation/service vessels.  All three vessels underwent significant refits in the early 2000s to enable them to perform a range of construction and maintenance duties in support of oil production platforms, as well as to continue to provide accommodation and related services for as many as 700 persons.\n\nSED is available to a seafarer who performs duties on a &#x201C;ship&#x201D; ([EIM33101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33101)) but not to a seafarer who performs duties on an &#x201C;offshore installation&#x201D; ([EIM33103](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33103)).  HMRC refused the appellants&#x2019; claims to SED because the appellants were at the relevant times working on an offshore installation involved -\n\n*   either mainly in providing accommodation (one of the definitions of a &#x201C;relevant use&#x201D; - see EIM33103), or\n*   in maintenance and repair activities which, following Torr (EIM33111), constitute a &#x201C;relevant use&#x201D; (EIM33103) because these activities are part of the process of exploiting mineral resources by means of a well.\n\nThe Judge in the First-Tier Tribunal found that the three Prosafe vessels carried out various tasks including\n\n*   lifting plant and machinery into position on platforms\n*   onboard fabrication, construction and assembly work,*   workshop, sandblasting and storage facilities,*   providing a base for diving operations, as well as\n*   providing significant accommodation and related services.\n\nThe Tribunal Judge found that following the upgrades to the three vessels, none of the Prosafe vessels was engaged &#x201C;mainly&#x201D; in providing accommodation (EIM33103).   He decided that after their upgrades the vessels were used as multi-purpose maintenance and construction support vessels and he commented that -\n\n**&#x201C;The vessels were in effect, floating toolboxes&#x201D;.**\n\nHowever, he declined to accept HMRC&#x2019;s contention that, following the decision in Torr (EIM33111), these activities were part of the process of exploiting mineral resources by means of a well because he found that the duties performed by the Prosafe vessels were not directly related to the extraction of mineral resources from wells.  Unlike the PSA in Torr, none of the duties on the Prosafe vessels were involved with well-head and/or associated subsea equipment or with well workover work.\n\n**&#x201C;Generally, their work was remote from actual oil extraction and/or processing.&#x201D;**\n\nConsequently the Tribunal Judge distinguished the facts in the Spowage case from those in Torr.  Unlike the PSA, which carried out activities in close association with the well and/or subsea equipment that comprised the production process (e.g. working down the well, pumping liquid down the well, removal and replacement of Xmas trees and construction of manifolds), the construction and maintenance carried out by the Prosafe vessels was too remote from the production process to be regarded as performed &#x201C;by means of a well&#x201D;.\n\nTherefore the duties carried out did not amount to a relevant use.  As the vessels did not perform a relevant use they were not offshore installations.  It follows that they should be treated as ships for the purposes of SED.\n\nThe Tribunal Judge also decided that the vessels had undertaken their duties whilst neither standing nor stationed.  This decision was dependent on its own facts.  As he had already decided that the vessels did not perform a relevant use, it was not relevant in determining the outcome of the appeals.\n\n### How does the decision in Spowage impact on the decision in Torr\n\nThe decision in Torr published in January 2008 supported a broad definition of the definition of &#x201C;exploiting mineral resources by means of a well&#x201D;, which could arguably include all parts of the process that occur between exploration of a mineral resource until extraction of the resource is complete and/or the production process is closed down.\n\nThe decision in Spowage takes a more restricted view of the same definition.  Whilst activities that involve extraction, storage and processing of the mineral resource, including in circumstances such as those carried out by the PSA in Torr, will continue to form part of the process of exploiting mineral resources by means of a well, construction and maintenance activities that are carried out remotely from the production process (e.g. away from the well head and/or associated subsea plant and equipment) will not form  part of the process of exploiting mineral resources by means of a well (see [EIM33105](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33105) and [EIM33106](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33106)).\n\n### Applying Spowage for 2008/09 onwards\n\nThe decisions in Torr and Spowage are complementary.  It would not be equitable to apply one without taking into account the other, particularly as the later decision (Spowage) has a direct impact in some circumstances on the scope of the application of the earlier decision (Torr).\n\nConsequently whilst HMRC has already issued guidance ([EIM33104](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33104) - [EIM33109](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM33000#EIM33109)) in February 2009 in relation to the Torr decision, and in particular how it should be applied for 2008/09 onwards, that guidance has been revised to take account of the later decision in Spowage as well.  The later decision in Spowage provides further clarity in relation to the earlier decision in Torr.\n\nAs HMRC has stated already that the Torr decision will apply for claims to SED from 2008/09 onwards, the clarification in Spowage of certain aspects of the Torr decision will also apply for claims to SED for 2008/09 onwards (see EIM33105 and EIM33106)."}]}]}}
