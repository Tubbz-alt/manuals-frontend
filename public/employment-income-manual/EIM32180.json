Private travel is defined by Section 338(5) ITEPA 2003 as travel between:\n\n* the employee's home and a place that is not a workplace, or\n* two places neither of which is a workplace.\n\nA workplace is a place that the employee **has to** attend to perform the duties of his or her employment, see [EIM32055](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32000#EIM32055). The effect of this rule is illustrated by example [EIM32181](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32181).\n\nNo deduction is due for travel that is made for private rather than work purposes, even if that travel is to or from a workplace that, in other circumstances, would be a temporary workplace. A place is only a workplace for those visits that the employee has to make. This is illustrated by example [EIM32182](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32182).\n\nPrivate travel includes travel that is substantially private travel, see [EIM32320](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32000#EIM32320).","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
