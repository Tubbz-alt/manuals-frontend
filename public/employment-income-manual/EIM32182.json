Each outlet is a temporary workplace (see [EIM32075](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32000#EIM32075)), so she is entitled to a deduction for the full costs of travelling between her home and each outlet.\n\nIn addition she is invited to the Christmas parties at each outlet. No deduction is due for the cost of her travel to attend these parties.\n\nThe outlets are temporary workplaces for those visits she has to make but they are not workplaces for those visits she chooses to make for non-work purposes, see [EIM32180](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM32180). The travel to attend Christmas parties is private travel.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
