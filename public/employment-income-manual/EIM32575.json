If the employer carries on a trade, etc, Section 356 will apply irrespective of whether the employer is a company, a sole trader, a partnership or a nationalised industry.\n\n### Organisations with mixed trading/non-trading activities\n\nSome organisations may carry on a mixture of trading and non-trading activities. In that case, Section 356 will potentially apply to employees who are engaged in the trading activities of such concerns, but not to those engaged in the non-trading activities.\n\n### Obtaining advice\n\nIf you are in doubt whether a particular activity constitutes a trade, business, profession or vocation, consult the Inspector dealing with the accounts of the organisation in question.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
