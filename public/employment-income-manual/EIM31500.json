In such cases, the employer leaves the employee to get a car from any reputable source without becoming involved in the purchasing or financing arrangements in any way.\n\nAn ECOS may be designed and administered by the employer, by a company within the same group as the employer, or by a third party that specialises in provision of alternative packages to the company car.\n\nIn essence an ECOS is designed to give employees similar benefits to a company car (for example a new car on a regular basis, central organisation of insurance and servicing) in a way that means the car benefit provisions do not apply.\n\n### Structure of employee car ownership schemes\n\nIn order to avoid car benefit, one or more of the car benefit conditions at [EIM23020](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23020) must not apply.  It is only possible to escape two of those conditions while still providing benefits akin to a company car, &#x201C;by reason of the employment&#x201D; and &#x201C;without any transfer of the property in it&#x201D;.\n\nThe employer&#x2019;s involvement makes it impossible to escape the first of those, so these schemes rely on avoiding the second.  To do so, ownership of the car in an ECOS is transferred to the employee at the outset (see [EIM23205](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23010#EIM23205)).\n\nSo, in reviewing a scheme, the first point to establish is whether the employee has become the owner of the car at the outset.  Only then can the ECOS succeed in avoiding car benefit.\n\n### Variations within ECOS\n\nThe phrases &#x201C;employee car ownership scheme&#x201D;, &#x201C;ECO&#x201D; or &#x201C;ECOS&#x201D;, ECOPs, SECOPs or Employee Car Plan are used to cover various different types of scheme.  So they are incapable on their own of telling you a great deal about how any particular scheme works.  In order to decide the tax and NICs consequences of any given scheme you will need to gain a detailed understanding of how it works by reading all the accompanying documentation.\n\nSee [EIM31505](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31505) for guidance on reviewing a scheme."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM31505","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31505","title":"Employee Car Ownership Schemes:    reviewing a scheme","body":"### Introductory remarks, common to this section of the guidance\n\nUnlike car benefit ([EIM23000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000)) and car fuel benefit ([EIM25500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500)), no single body of legislation deals with ECOS.

In order to review a scheme, you will need to see all the documentation.  This may include any of the following:\n\n*   document or brochure outlining the scheme\n*   scheme rules\n*   agreements between employee and employer*   agreements between employee and finance provider*   agreements between employee and car provider*   correspondence and agreements between the employer and any third parties involved, such as the finance provider and/or the car provider\n*   instructions to managers about the operation of the scheme.\n\nAny of these may exist in more than one form; make sure you see all variations.\n\nThis list is not intended to be exhaustive; other documentation may also be relevant to understanding any given scheme.  Ask for all relevant documentation.  It is likely to be complex and is often voluminous.  Do not be put off; advice is available to help you with this.\n\n### Status of advice\n\nAs the transactions in the scheme depend on the agreements actually entered into by the various parties involved, you will be unable to form any definitive view of the tax or NICs consequences of a particular scheme until it has actually been introduced.\n\nEven then, your view will be based only on the documents you have seen, so an employer or scheme provider making any changes either to those documents or to the way the scheme operates will no longer be able to rely on any agreements you have reached about earlier versions of the scheme.  You should make this clear whenever you comment on schemes.\n\n### Advice on similar schemes\n\nYou should make it clear that any view you express on a particular set of documents only applies to that employer and does not apply to any other employer&#x2019;s use of the same or similar arrangements.\n\nFor the same reason, you should not rely on statements that someone else has seen and approved a scheme claimed to be identical to the one on which you are being asked to advise.  Changes may have been made to the way the scheme operates.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM31510","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31510","title":"Employee Car Ownership Schemes:    tax and NICs consequences of using ECOS arrangements","body":"### Introductory remarks, common to this section of the guidance\n\nUnlike car benefit ([EIM23000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM23000)) and car fuel benefit ([EIM25500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM25500)), no single body of legislation deals with ECOS.

Under those regimes, the only possible charges are for the car, fuel and (exceptionally) a chauffeur; all other charges are subsumed within those.\n\nBecause this is not so for an ECOS, the result is that every individual transaction has to be considered for both tax and NICs.   Examples are:\n\n*   the price at which the vehicle is sold to the employee, see [EIM21640](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21601#EIM21640) onwards\n*   the amount at which the employee can resell the car to the employer or provider (often referred to as the &#x2018;guaranteed future value&#x2019;), see [EIM21660](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM21601#EIM21660) onwards*   provision of any benefits in kind, such as vehicle excise duty, insurance, repairs and servicing , see [EIM31535](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31535)&#xA0;\n*   where any payment is made in connection with the vehicle, see [EIM31520](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31520).\n\nThis list is not intended to be exhaustive.

Any single payment may comprise more than one kind, but the kind of payment is fixed when it is made.  It is not possible later to treat a payment of one kind as though it had been a payment of another.\n\n### 1.  Payments to the employee in respect of mileage expenses of business travel\n\nAn example of such a payment is where an employer pays the employee a flat rate per business mile.\n\nFor tax, such payments come within the AMAPs legislation, as described from [EIM31200](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200) onwards.  They are &#x2018;mileage allowance payments&#x2019;, or MAPs; see [EIM31210](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200#EIM31210) for the statutory definition and for the kind of expense covered.  Payments in respect of other vehicle-related business travel expenses are likely to come within Kind 2.\n\nFor NICs, they are Relevant Motoring Expenditure (RME, Reg 22A(3)(a) SSCR 2001, SI 2001 No 1004, as amended by SI 2004 No 770) precisely because they are MAPs; see [NIM05815](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/NIM05815.htm) for the statutory definition of RME.\n\nThere is a brief summary of AMAPs at [EIM31580](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31580) and of the NICs mileage scheme at [EIM31585](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31585).\n\n### 2.  Payments to the employee in respect of the use of the vehicle, including private use\n\nFor tax, these can be of two kinds:\n\n1.  business expense payments which are not MAPs (e.g. tolls, parking; full details can be found at [EIM31215](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200#EIM31215)).  The normal travel rules apply to these payments, see [EIM31800](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31800) onwards and NIM05825.2.  otherwise (including if in connection with private use), they are simply earnings and are within Kind 3 below.\n\nFor NICs, all payments to the employee in connection with the use of the vehicle are RME (see NIM05825).  Such payments come within the NICs mileage scheme, see brief summary at [EIM31585](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31585).\n\n### 3.  Payments to the employee unconnected with either business mileage expenses or use of the vehicle\n\nThese include payments in respect of ownership of the car rather than its use.  They are simply earnings for both tax and NICs.  They should be added to other earnings and dealt with through the employer&#x2019;s normal PAYE scheme in exactly the same way as the employee&#x2019;s normal salary.\n\n### Telling the difference between the above kinds of payment\n\nWhere\n\n*   an employer asserts that a payment is a contribution towards or is designed to meet an employee&#x2019;s costs incurred using their car for business travel, and\n*   an employee incurs costs using their car for business travel\n\ndo not automatically accept that the payment is for the use of the vehicle.  Establish the facts to determine the true nature of the payment.  You may find that the payment is simply a round sum allowance or additional pay.  The types of facts you should establish include\n\n*   when is payment made\n*   who is entitled to payment\n*   what entitles them to payment: is it their grade or their expected business mileage\n*   when payment stops\n*   what happens when an employee is promoted\n*   what happens when an employee is sick\n*   conditions that must be satisfied before the payment is made, for example, restrictions placed on the type of car, age of car, minimum business mileage, etc.\n*   how the amount paid is calculated and whether it bears any correlation to the actual use of the vehicle.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**&#xA0;\n\n### Other kinds of transaction in favour of the employee\n\nThese are listed with links to the relevant guidance at [EIM31520](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31520).

They are not within PAYE, but instead are reported on form P11D for the tax year at section B.  The amount so reported is added to the employee&#x2019;s earnings for tax (but not payroll) purposes.\n\nThis is explained at [EIM00580](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00580) and the PAYE treatment at [EIM00590](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00590).\n\n**For NICs, **they can be of two kinds:\n\n1.  payments would have been MAPs had they been paid to the employee, or are otherwise in respect of the use of the vehicle **but are not a payment in kind** (e.g. payment of a servicing or repair bill for which the contract was with the employee) are Relevant Motoring Expenditure (RME, Reg 22A(3)(b) SSCR 2001, SI 2001 No 1004, as amended by SI 2004 No 770) and come within the NICs mileage scheme, see brief summary at [EIM31585](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31585).2.  all other payments of the employee&#x2019;s personal (pecuniary) liability (e.g. payments direct to the loan provider of amounts due from the employee under the ECOS): these are earnings subject to Class 1 NICs.  They should be added to any other earnings paid in the same earnings period when calculating Class 1 NICs.\n\n### Other kinds of transaction in favour of the employee\n\nThese are listed with links to the relevant guidance at [EIM31520](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31520).

Therefore they cannot be exempt from tax as AMAPs.\n\nNote that the full amount of the benefit is chargeable, not merely the private proportion, because business mileage expenses are only relieved via Mileage Allowance Relief, see [EIM31330](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200#EIM31330).  Deduction under the normal travel rules is prohibited by section 359 ITEPA.\n\nThis point is often not understood.  A typical example is fuel provided for an employee&#x2019;s own car as a benefit in kind.  The entire cost of provision is chargeable as a benefit, not merely the cost of the fuel provided for private use.\n\nThe above is subject to the normal reduction for amounts made good by the employee to the provider of the benefit, see EIM21120 to 21122.\n\n### Tax treatment\n\nBenefits in kind are reported on form P11D unless made good in full by the employee before the P11D is due to be submitted.\n\nSubject to the full amount of the benefit being chargeable, benefits in kind are explained at [EIM20000](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM20000) onwards.\n\n### NICs treatment\n\nBenefits in kind are subject to Class 1A NICs and are reported on form P11D(b) unless made good in full by the employee before the P11D(b) is submitted.  They are explained at NIM13000CO onwards.  Class 1A NICs are due on the amount chargeable to tax.  No deduction is allowed for business mileage expenses.\n\n### Other kinds of transaction in favour of the employee\n\nThese are listed with links to the relevant guidance at [EIM31520](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31500#EIM31520).

If it is in the form of a loan, the position is different as described on this page.\n\n### Genuine loans\n\nA genuine loan is not earnings for either for tax or NICs but is instead subject to the beneficial loans legislation.  Guidance on this for tax can be found starting at [EIM26100](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM26100) and for NICs at NIM13150.\n\n### Other payments described as loans\n\nThere is one exception to the rule above.  We do not accept that a payment in respect of business fuel expenses already incurred can be described as a loan in any meaningful sense.\n\nSuch a payment is in principle immediately taxable as an expenses payment under section 72 ITEPA.  Because it is a Mileage Allowance Payment (MAP, [EIM31210](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200#EIM31210)), actual chargeability is subject to exemption as AMAPs, [EIM31230](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM31200#EIM31230).  As a MAP, it is also Relevant Motoring Expenditure (RME, Reg 22A(3)(b) SSCR 2001, SI 2001 No 1004, as amended by SI 2004 No 770; see NIM05815).

The different kinds of transaction in favour of the employee are detailed at EIM31520.\n\nThe amounts may be different for tax and NICs, but the transactions can fall into these kinds:\n\n*   PAYE income for tax and earnings on which Class 1 NICs are due\n*   benefits in kind for tax and NICs\n*   earnings liable for Class 1 NICs but reportable on P11D for tax\n*   exempt from tax and NICs.\n\nAll amounts which consist of PAYE income for tax or are earnings on which Class 1 NICs are due must be dealt with through the employer&#x2019;s PAYE scheme in each earnings period.  They cannot be put on one side to be reconciled at the end of the tax year.\n\nAn ECOS scheme provider may assist an employer by collecting employee business mileage records and working out what part of the payment made to an employee in connection with an ECOS is taxable as PAYE income and liable to Class 1 NICs.\n\nBut the employer is still responsible for recording the taxable and NICable amounts on the deductions working sheet prepared for the employee in connection with wages or salaries, recording the tax and NICs due, and accounting for the tax and NICs to HMRC.  This is because Reg 66(2) of the Income Tax (PAYE) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2682) states that:\n&#x201C;The employer must, on making a relevant payment to the employee, prepare a deductions working sheet (unless he has already done so)&#x201D;.\n\nIf the payments made under ECOS are either PAYE income for tax or earnings on which Class 1 NICs are due, they must be entered on the deduction working sheet (DWS) operated by that employer.  The employer cannot run two DWS for the same employee.  Each employee must therefore be in one, and only one, PAYE scheme.\n\n### Separate PAYE schemes for ECOS payments not permissible\n\nIt follows that a separate PAYE scheme for the employer in respect of the ECOS payments should not be agreed and PAYE schemes should not be opened in the name of the provider in relation to the ECOS payments. This includes &#x2018;Free of Tax&#x2019; schemes and other special arrangements.
