The director contributes &#xA3;2,000 to the cost. It was first registered in 1971 and had a list price then of &#xA3;2,800 (assume this can be established with reasonable certainty). During the year the car is renovated at a cost of &#xA3;5,000 and on 5 April 2004 it has a market value of &#xA3;17,500.\n\n### Normal calculation: steps 1 to 4 for 2003/04\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Section 121**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n**Item**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n**Price of item, &#xA3;**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n**Running total, &#xA3;**\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Step 1**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n2,800\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n2,800\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Step 2**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nAccessories - assume that renovations simply involve provision of replacement accessories (see [EIM24255](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24000#EIM24255)) and that no additions are necessary at step 2.\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n2,800\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Step 3**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nCapital contributions.\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n2,000\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n800\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Step 4**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nInterim sum (figure at Step 4 without the classic car rules; amount carried forward from Step 3 from 2011/12).\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n800\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Consideration of classic car rules\n\nHowever, the normal calculation is not the end of the story. The conditions in Section 147(2) are fulfilled:\n\n*   the age of the car at 5 April 2004 is at least 15 years*   its market value for the year is &#xA3;17,500, which is more than &#xA3;15,000.\n*   that value exceeds the amount carried forward from step 3 of Section 121(1) (&#xA3;800)\n\nThe car is therefore a classic car within Section 147 (see [EIM24400](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM24000#EIM24400) onwards). Section 147(2) therefore specifies the following action:\n\n*   for the amount carried forward from step 3 substitute the market value of the car for the year less any deductions under Subsection (6), capital contributions to classic cars.\n\n### Calculation using classic car rules: steps 1 to 4 for 2003/04\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Section 121**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n**Item**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n**Price of item, &#xA3;**\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n**Running total, &#xA3;**\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n**Step 3 **\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n(Car plus accessories less capital contribution, as above).\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n800\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n800\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\nCancel this\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n800\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\nand replace by market value\n\nless capital contribution\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n17,500\n\n2,000\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n15,500\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\nInterim sum (final figure at step 4; amount carried forward from Step 3 from 2011/12).\n\n</td>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n\n15,500\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM23000","EIM24000","EIM24460"],"section_groups":[]}}
