The decision to\nacquire a home outside the UK through a company is frequently\ninfluenced by the laws of the country in which the property is\nlocated rather than the possible UK tax consequences.\n\n Individuals acquiring a home in this manner who direct the\ncompany's affairs but who do not hold a formal appointment as\ndirector fall within Part 3 Chapter 5 ITEPA 2003 in the same way as\nif they did hold a formal appointment (see\n[EIM11413](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11413)).\n\n The exemption only applies to the living accommodation\nbenefit charge as applicable to company officers and others who\ndirect the company&#x2019;s affairs and members of their family or\nhousehold. It has no effect on the other UK tax consequences that\nmay result from the decision to acquire a home outside the UK\nthrough a company.\n\n### Main conditions\n\nSection 100A includes conditions relating to ownership of the\ncompany and the company&#x2019;s activities. Broadly, the effect of\nthese conditions is to limit the exemption to circumstances where\nan individual uses their own money to provide funds to enable the\ncompany to acquire living accommodation outside the UK for their\nown or their family&#x2019;s use. The company&#x2019;s only\nactivities are limited to those that are incidental to its\nownership of the property. An example of an incidental activity is\nthe letting out of the property when it is not occupied by the\nindividual owner etc. This limitation on the company&#x2019;s\nactivities means that the exemption does not apply to individuals\nwho are provided with the living accommodation as part of a\nremuneration package provided in return for performing duties of an\nemployment.\n\n### Meaning of company\n\nCompany is defined in section 992 ITA 2007 as any body corporate\nor unincorporated association other than a partnership, a local\nauthority or a local authority association. This wide definition is\nnot restricted to companies registered in the UK and includes a\nnumber of entities formed under foreign law through which\nindividuals may acquire homes outside the UK. Such entities will\ngenerally be classified as opaque for UK tax purposes. Examples\ninclude the ownership of a home in France through a &#x201C;Societe\nCivile Immobiliere&#x201D; (SCI) or in the United States through a\nLimited Liability Company (LLC).\n\n### Detailed guidance and example\n\nEIM11372 describes the conditions in section 100A that have to\nbe satisfied for the exemption to apply.\n[EIM11373](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11373) explains the circumstances set\nout in section 100B which limit the application of section 100A.\nThe example in\n[EIM11374](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11374) describes a typical scenario to\nwhich the exemption applies.\n\n### Retrospective effect\n\nSection 45(2) FA 2008 provides that sections 100A and 100B are\nto be treated as always having had effect. This means that where\nthe exemption applies no liability to income tax in respect of the\nbenefit of the accommodation arises for any tax year. An individual\nwho has paid tax for any year charged in an assessment or included\nin a self-assessment in respect of living accommodation within\nsection 100A is therefore entitled to request a repayment of that\ntax."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM11372","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11372","title":"Living accommodation exemption: homes outside the United Kingdom owned through a company: specific conditions in section 100A ITEPA 2003","body":"Certain conditions have to be satisfied if living accommodation\noutside the UK provided by a company for a director or other\nofficer of the company or a member of that person&#x2019;s family or\nhousehold is to qualify for exemption from the benefit charge on\nprovided living accommodation. These conditions are set out in\nsection 100A and are described below.\n\n### Company ownership\n\nIn order for the exemption to apply, section 100A provides that\nthe company:\n\n*   must be wholly owned by the director or\nother officer of the company or by that person and other\nindividuals with no interest in the company being partnership\nproperty and\n*   must have been the holding company of the\nproperty at all times after the relevant time\n\nThe requirement that the company must be wholly owned by\nindividuals means that the exemption will not apply where the\nholding company of the property is owned via a trust. This does not\napply to a bare trust or nominee arrangement. Bare trusts are\ntreated for tax purposes as if the beneficiary holds the trust\nproperty in his or her own name.

The special rules apply to a premium payable under a lease entered into on or after 22 April 2009 or on the extension of the term of an existing lease on or after that date.\n\n### Section 105(4) and (4A) ITEPA\n\nThese provisions apply where a rental amount is payable by the person at whose cost the accommodation is provided (&#x201C;P&#x201D;) in respect of the whole or part of the taxable period (&#x201C;the relevant period&#x201D;) at an annual rate greater than the annual value of the accommodation.\n\nFor the meaning of annual value see [EIM11432](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11432).\n\nFor the meaning of taxable period see [EIM11428](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11428).\n\nIn these circumstances, the cash equivalent to be treated as earnings from the employment will be the difference between the rental amount payable by P and any sum made good by the employee to P that is properly attributable to the provision of the accommodation.\n\n### Section 105(4B) ITEPA\n\nSubsection (4B) defines &#x201C;rental amount payable by P&#x201D; as the sum of any rent for the relevant period payable by P and any amount attributed to the period in respect of a lease premium.\n\n### Sections 105A and 105B ITEPA\n\nThese provisions contain the detailed rules for attributing an amount to the relevant period in respect of a lease premium.  For these purposes, lease premium means any premium payable under a lease or otherwise under the terms on which a lease is granted and in Scotland includes a grassum.\n\n### Interaction with Section 106 ITEPA\n\nSection 106 applies where the cost of providing living accommodation exceeds &#xA3;75,000. As the amount of a premium represents the cost of acquiring a leasehold interest, it is a cost of acquiring property for the purpose of determining the cost of providing living accommodation (see [EIM11429](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11429)).  [EIM11480](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11480) explains how to calculate the amount of the living accommodation benefit under Section 106. The first step in the Section 106 calculation is to calculate what would be the cash equivalent if Section 105 applied.  An amount attributed in respect of a lease premium will therefore be included in the cash equivalent of the benefit regardless of the cost of providing the accommodation.\n\nThe second step in Section 106 is to calculate the additional yearly rent. Extra Statutory Concession A91 (ESC A91) only applies where the cash equivalent of the benefit of the accommodation is calculated by reference to the annual rent the property might fetch on the open market.  It does not apply where the cash equivalent is calculated by reference to a lease premium. It follows that the cash equivalent of the benefit will include the additional yearly rent in lease premium cases to which Section 106 applies.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nSee [EIM11445](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11445) onwards for a detailed description of the rules and examples of how the rules apply in practice."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM11445","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11445","title":"Living accommodation: lease premium cases: detailed attribution rules: when to attribute an amount in respect of a lease premium","body":"See [EIM11444](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11444) for an overview of the changes made by Section 71 FA 2009.\n\nAn amount in respect of a lease premium can only be attributed to a relevant period where **all** four conditions in Section 105A(1) ITEPA are satisfied:\n\n*   The property consists of premises, or a part of premises, that are subject to a lease.\n*   The premises are not mainly used by P for a purpose other than the provision of living accommodation to which Part 3 Chapter 5 ITEPA applies.\n*   The lease is for a term of 10 years or less.\n*   The net amount payable by P in relation to the lease by way of lease premium is greater than zero.\n\n&#x201C;P&#x201D; is the person at whose cost the accommodation is provided.\n\n&#x201C;The relevant period&#x201D; is the whole or part of the &#x201C;taxable period&#x201D; - see [EIM11428](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11428).\n\n### Property consists of premises, or a part of premises, that are subject to a lease\n\nIn this context, &#x201C;the property&#x201D; means the property consisting of the living accommodation.  To satisfy this condition, the living accommodation must be subject to a lease whether it comprises the whole of the premises or forms only a part of larger premises.  In practice, deciding if the first condition has been satisfied should be straightforward.\n\n### Premises not mainly used by P for a purpose other than the provision of living accommodation\n\nThis condition prevents the attribution of an amount in respect of a lease premium where the main use of the premises by P is for a purpose other than the provision of living accommodation to which Part 3 Chapter 5 ITEPA applies.\n\nThe construction of the premises will often be such that a separate part is clearly designed and used for business use rather than living accommodation.  An example would be premises consisting of a shop with a flat over it.  In such a case the living accommodation is only the flat above the shop and does not include any of the shop below.\n\n&#x201C;Mainly&#x201D; takes its everyday meaning as &#x201C;for the most part&#x201D; and all relevant factors should be taken into account.  It will therefore be necessary to identify the proportion of the premises used by P for providing living accommodation and the proportion actually used for other purposes.  Remember that the legislation is concerned with actual use of part of the premises for other purposes and not mere provision for other purposes.  Generally, it should be sufficient to compare the area of the living accommodation with the area of the whole premises.  However, the specific facts may indicate that P mainly uses the premises for other purposes even where living accommodation takes up more than 500f the area of the whole premises.  For example, it may be clear that the value of the part of the premises used for other purposes is significantly greater than the value of the part used as living accommodation such that the provision of living accommodation clearly represents an ancillary activity.\n\nNote that any part of the premises used by P for providing living accommodation to an employee entitled to one of the statutory exemptions set out at [EIM11331](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11331) is used for a purpose other than the provision of living accommodation to which Part 3 Chapter 5 ITEPA applies.  For example, if the premises consist of a three storey building with a shop at ground floor level, a first floor flat provided to an employee entitled to an exemption and a second floor flat provided to an employee who is not entitled to an exemption, only the second floor flat is living accommodation to which Part 3 Chapter 5 applies.\n\n### Lease is for a term of 10 years or less\n\nThe term of the lease will usually be clear. However it is subject to the special rules in Section 105B ITEPA which determine the term of a lease that contains one or more relevant break clauses.  A relevant break clause is a provision of a lease that gives a person a right to terminate the lease which can be exercised in such a way that the term of the original lease will be 10 years or less.  For the purposes of Section 105A, it is assumed that any relevant break clause is exercised in such a way that the term of the lease is as short as possible.\n\nFor example, if the term of a lease is stated as 15 years but there is a relevant break clause which would allow a person to terminate the lease after 5 years, the term of the original lease is determined as 5 years for the purposes of Section 105A.\n\n### Net amount payable by P in relation to a lease by way of lease premium is greater than zero\n\nSection 105A(4) defines the above expression as the total amount (if any) that has been paid, or is or will become payable, by P in relation to the lease by way of lease premium, less any of that amount that has been repaid or is or will become repayable.  In practice, where there is a premium payable under a lease, determining whether this condition has been satisfied should give little difficulty.\n\nWhere all four conditions are satisfied, [EIM11446](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11446) explains how to calculate the amount to be attributed to the relevant period.\n\n**(This text has been withheld because of exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act 2000)**"},{"manual-section-id":"EIM11446","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11446","title":"Living accommodation: lease premium cases: calculating the amount to be attributed in respect of a lease premium: general explanation","body":"See [EIM11444](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11444) for an overview of the changes made by Section 71 FA 2009 and [EIM11445](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11445) for details of the conditions that need to be satisfied before an amount in respect of a lease premium can be attributed to a relevant period.\n\nIn this guidance:\n\n*   &#x201C;P&#x201D; is the person at whose cost the accommodation is provided\n*   &#x201C;the relevant period&#x201D; is the whole or part of the &#x201C;taxable period&#x201D; (see [EIM11428](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11428))\n*   the net amount payable by P in relation to the lease by way of lease premium is the total amount (if any) that has been paid, or is or will become payable, by P in relation to the lease by way of lease premium, less any of that amount that has been repaid or is or will become repayable.\n\nSection 105A(2) ITEPA sets out the formula for finding the amount to be attributed to the relevant period in respect of a lease premium:\n\nThe rules are modified where the lease contains a relevant break clause - see [EIM11448](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11448).

The property is subject to a lease the original term of which is 12 years from 6 April 2010.  There is a relevant break clause which would allow a person to terminate the lease after 5 years.  The total amount payable by P in relation to the lease by way of lease premium is &#xA3;300,000 but &#xA3;175,000 of this will become repayable if the break clause is exercised.

The effect of the legislation will have been to treat the amount of &#xA3;125,000 as if it were rent paid and spread over the duration of the lease.  In the example, the effect of rounding means that the amount attributed is slightly less (&#xA3;124,998) than &#xA3;125,000.\n\n### Break clause not exercised\n\nIf the relevant break clause is not exercised on 6 April 2015, the parties to the lease are treated as parties to a notional lease which begins immediately.  In this example, as there is only one relevant break clause, the notional lease will end on the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the term of the original lease i.e. 6 April 2020.\n\nSection 105B(7) applies where the notional lease ends on the tenth anniversary.  It provides that the net amount payable by P in relation to the notional lease by way of lease premium is the relevant proportion of:\n\nAs the break clause has not been exercised, no part of the total amount of lease premium is repayable so the net amount payable will be &#xA3;300,000 of which the amount of &#xA3;124,998 has already been attributed and taxed in the years 2010-11 to 2014-15.  Therefore, it will be necessary in this case to find the relevant proportion of &#xA3;175,002.\n\nThe relevant proportion is set out in Section 105B(8) as the fraction D/E where:\n\nIn this case, the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the term of the original lease is 6 April 2020 and the original lease is for a term of 12 years ending in 2022 so:\n\n**2015-16 to 2019-20 (term of notional lease)  **\n\nApplying the relevant proportion to &#xA3;175,002 gives &#xA3;124,251 which is the net amount payable by P in relation to the notional lease by way of lease premium.  The amount of lease premium to be attributed to each of the above five years will be:\n\n**2015-16 and 2019-20**\n\n366/1827*&#xA3;124,251 = &#xA3;24,981\n\n**2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19**\n\n365/1827*&#xA3;124,251 = &#xA3;24,822\n\n### Comment\n\nThe effect of the rules is to treat the lease premium as if it were rent paid and spread over the duration of the lease without attributing any amount to any part of the term of the lease that in fact exceeds ten years.  In this example of a lease with an original term of 12 years, broadly 10/12 of the total lease premium has been attributed over the first ten years of the term of the lease.\n\n### More than one relevant break clause\n\nWhere there is more than one notional lease, the last notional lease will end on the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the term of the original lease.  The above example shows how to apply the formula in Section 105A(2) for a notional lease ending on the tenth anniversary.\n\nFor other notional leases, the value of C in the formula in Section 105A(2) is determined under Section 105B(6).  This provides that for the purposes of Section 105A the net amount payable by P in relation to a notional lease by way of lease premium is the net amount that would be payable by P on the assumption that any relevant break clause that is exercisable only after the beginning of the term of the notional lease is exercised in such a way that the term of the original lease is as short as possible.  This amount is then reduced for any part that has already been attributed to a period in respect of a lease premium.\n\n### Calculating the cash equivalent\n\nAs the cost of providing the accommodation exceeds &#xA3;75,000, the cash equivalent will be calculated under Section 106 (see [EIM11444](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11444)).\n\nIn this example, the cash equivalent for each year will be the sum of any rent for the period payable by P and the amount attributed to the period in respect of a lease premium plus the additional yearly rent calculated in accordance with Step 2 of Section 106, subject to any further adjustments required by Steps 3 and 4 (see [EIM11480](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11480))."}]},{"title":" Living accommodation: Section 106 ITEPA 2003: measure of charge","sections":[{"manual-section-id":"EIM11472","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11472","title":"Living accommodation: properties costing more than &#xA3;75,000","body":"## Section 106 ITEPA 2003 and Extra-Statutory Concession A91\n\nThe amount of the benefit depends on the cost of the property (see [EIM11428](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11428)).\n\nFor the definition of the cost of providing the living accommodation see [EIM11429](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM11300#EIM11429).\n\nThis page relates to living accommodation that cost the provider more than &#xA3;75,000.
