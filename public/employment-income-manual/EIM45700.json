See [EIM45865](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45865.htm).\n\n### What kind of income?\n\nIt counts as employment income of A in respect of A&#x2019;s employment with B.\n\nThis rule takes priority over the benefits code. So, for example, if the relevant step is the making of an employment-related loan, the loan gives rise to Part 7A income and is not treated as a taxable cheap loan.  On the benefits code and loans, see [EIM26101](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM26100#EIM26101) onwards.\n\nSimilarly, this rule takes priority over Part 4 Chapter 3 ITTOIA 2005 (savings and investment income: dividends etc from UK resident companies etc).\n\n### When?\n\nIn general, it counts as A&#x2019;s employment income for the tax year in which the relevant step is taken.\n\nBut, if the relevant step is taken before A&#x2019;s employment with B starts, it counts as A&#x2019;s employment income for the tax year in which the employment starts.\n\nSee also [EIM45720](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45720.htm) (residence issues).\n\n### How much?\n\nFor the measure of the income, see [EIM45710](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm)."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM45710","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45710","title":"Value of relevant step","body":"\n\n## Section 554Z3 ITEPA 2003\n\n[Market value](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm#IDAKKURH)\n[Cost](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm#IDAGLURH)\n[Example: asset falls in value](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm#IDAGNURH)\n[Priority rules](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm#IDA5OURH)\n\nIf the relevant step involves a sum of money, its value is the amount of the sum.\n\nIf it does not, its value is the higher of:\n\n*   the market value of the asset which is the subject of the step, and\n*   the cost of the relevant step.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm#top)\n\n\n## Market value\n\nYou apply the capital gains tax rules to calculate market value.\n\nYou calculate the market value of the asset as at the time when the relevant step is taken.\n\nThe market value rule is subject to Sections 437 and 452 ITEPA 2003, which provide for the specific valuation of convertible securities and shares in research institution spin-out companies respectively.

Both these cases involve employment-related securities.\n\nFirst, you ignore the cost if:\n\n*   the relevant step is within Section 554C(1)(c) (securities, interests in securities etc, see [EIM45060](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45060)), and\n*   any of Part 7 Chapters 2 to 4A ITEPA 2003 apply to the acquisition, see ERSM20100.\n\nSecond, you ignore the cost if Section 554Z7 (exercise price of share options) applies.

There are no subtrusts and the trustee does not allocate the work of art to any particular employee or beneficiary.\n*   On 1 May 2011 the EBT transfers the work of art to employee A for nil consideration.  By now, the work of art has fallen in value.  Its market value on 1 May 2011 is &#xA3;1.2million.\n*   The transfer is a relevant step within Section 554C(1)(b).  See [EIM45060](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45060).\n*   In order to work out the value of the relevant step, you compare the market value at the time the step is taken (&#xA3;1.2 million) with the cost (&#xA3;1.5 million).\n*   In this case, the cost is higher and so the value of the relevant step is the cost of &#xA3;1.5million.\n\nIn practice, it is likely that the transfer of the property by the trustee to the employee will give rise to earnings from the employee&#x2019;s employment.  See [EIM00515](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM00505#EIM00515) onwards.  If so, you will need to reduce the value of the relevant step by the amount of the relevant earnings.

Calculate the total amount of the sums of money included in the subject of the step.\n\n**Step 2**.  Calculate the total market value, as at the time the step is taken of the assets included in the subject of the step.\n\nOn the sums of money and assets included in the subject of the step, see [EIM45155](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45155).\n\n**Step 3**.  Add together the totals you calculated at Steps 1 and 2.\n\n**Step 4**.  Establish whether any term of the security limits the total amount which may be made available under the security for the performance of the relevant undertaking.  If there is no such term, the total you calculated at Step 3 is the value of the security. Otherwise, go to Step 5.\n\n**Step 5**.  Reduce the total you calculated at Step 3 on a just and reasonable basis to take account of the term mentioned in Step 4.  The result is the value of the security.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45715.htm#top)\n\n\n## Value of anniversary step within Section 554Z19\n\nIf B continues to provide the security for over a year, there will be at least one deemed &#x2018;anniversary step&#x2019; within Section 554Z19.  See [EIM45155](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45155).\n\nTo value the anniversary step under review, you look back over the year ending on the anniversary day.\n\nYou take the five steps set out above.  Steps 1 and 2 apply with two possible modifications.\n\nFirst, the total amount of the sums of money which are the subject of the security may vary from time to time.\n\nIf it does, then you find the time during the year ending on the anniversary day when this total was at its highest.  That is the total which you include in the subject of the anniversary step.\n\nSecond, if the subject of the anniversary step included an asset, then that asset&#x2019;s market value can be determined as at any time during the year ending on the anniversary day so long as the subject of the security was (or included) that asset at that time.  The employer can choose any valuation date within that year.  This means that, if the same asset is used as security for several different undertakings with different anniversary days, the asset does not have to be valued as at different dates.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45715.htm#top)\n\n\n## Priority rules\n\nIn order to arrive at the value of the relevant step (and thus the amount counting as employment income) you may need to apply some other rules which override the rules in Section 554Z20 discussed above on this page.\n\nThese other rules are listed below.

It is immediately allocated into a sub-fund to be applied for the benefit of employee A&#x2019;s spouse and children.\n\nThe allocation of the value of &#xA3;1.2 million into the sub-fund is an earmarking relevant step within Section 554B (see [EIM45095](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45095)) and the arrangement comes through the Section 554A gateway (see [EIM45025](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45025)).  The earmarked amount of &#xA3;1.2 million counts as employment income of A on 1 July 2011 and is taxable accordingly.\n\nOn 1 March 2012 the trustee sells the freehold property and receives net proceeds of &#xA3;1.1million.\n\nOn 15 March 2012 the trustee uses the proceeds to fund a loan of &#xA3;1 million to A.\n\nThis is a relevant step within Section 554C (see [EIM45060](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45060)).  As the advance of the loan is a step that involves a sum of money, the starting point for working out the value that counts as employment income is the full amount of the sum involved, namely &#xA3;1 million (see [EIM45710](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45710.htm)).\n\nHowever, this sum is directly referable to the earmarked amount of &#xA3;1.2 million that has already counted as employment income of A within Part 7A.\n\nUsing the three steps set out above, you calculate the overlap as follows.\n\nStep 1:  The value of the earlier relevant step was &#xA3;1.2 million.\n\nStep 2:  The value of the current relevant step is &#xA3;1 million.\n\nStep 3:  You reduce the value calculated at Step 2 by the value calculated at Step 1 (but not beyond nil).  So the value of the current relevant step is reduced to nil.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45725.htm#top)\n\n\n## Reduction under Section 554Z5 if sum or asset P overlaps only part of sum or asset Q\n\nYou take four steps to reduce the value of the relevant step if the overlap covers only part of sum or asset Q.\n\n**Step 1**.  Calculate the value of the earlier relevant step after any reductions under:\n\n*   Section 554Z4 (residence issues), see [EIM45720](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45720.htm),\n*   Section 554Z5, or\n*   Section 554Z7 (exercise price of share options), see [EIM45740](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45740.htm) onwards.\n\nThis value is not necessarily the amount of the Part 7A income generated by that step, because you ignore any reductions under Section 554Z6 or Section 554Z8 (see [EIM45735](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45735.htm) and [EIM45755](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45755.htm) onwards respectively).\n\n**Step 2**.  Determine, on a just and reasonable basis, the part of the value calculated at Step 1 which corresponds to the part of sum or asset Q covered by the     overlap.\n\n**Step 3**.  Calculate the value of the relevant step under review after any reductions under Section 554Z4.\n\n**Step 4**.  Reduce the value of the relevant step calculated at Step 3 by the result of Step 2.\n\n[Top of page](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM45725.htm#top)\n\n\n## Indirect overlap\n\nSum or asset P can also overlap another sum or asset indirectly.  Suppose, in Step 1, Section 554Z5 reduced the value of the earlier relevant step because sum or asset Q overlapped another sum of money or asset (&#x2018;sum or asset #3&#x2019;).  Then sum or asset P overlaps sum or asset #3 to the extent that it overlapped with sum or asset Q.\n\nThis means that you have to apply Section 554Z5 again, reducing the value of the relevant step whose subject is sum or asset P.  This time you reduce it by reference to the value of sum or asset#3."},{"manual-section-id":"EIM45730","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45730","title":"Overlap with earlier relevant step: undertakings and provision of security in relation to retirement benefits etc","body":"\n\n## Sections 554Z5 and 554Z19 ITEPA 2003\n\nIn summary, B takes a step within Section 554Z19 if B provides security for the performance of a relevant undertaking.\n\nB may also be deemed to take additional steps within Section 554Z19 if B continues to provide security.\n\nOn Section 554Z19, see [EIM45155](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM45000#EIM45155).
