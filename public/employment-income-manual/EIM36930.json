{"title":"balancing allowances and charges","details":{"manual-section-id":"EIM36930","body":"This example shows how balancing adjustments are calculated (see [EIM36680](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM36500#EIM36680)).\n\nA salesman working from home ceases employment on 30 November 2009. Capital allowances had previously been claimed on the following items:\n\n*   an electric typewriter with a residual value brought forward at 6 April 2009 of &#xA3;80. On cessation of employment the typewriter was sold for &#xA3;100, which is less than its original cost.\n*   an answering machine with a residual value brought forward at 6 April 2009 of &#xA3;50. The salesman retains the machine for private use. Its market value at cessation was &#xA3;20.\n*   an overhead projector with a residual value brought forward at 6 April 2009 of &#xA3;72. The projector was bought in the previous year for &#xA3;120, but on cessation the taxpayer manages to sell it for &#xA3;130.\n\nBoth the typewriter and the answering machine were used 10 per cent for private purposes, but the projector was used wholly for business.\n\nThe balancing adjustments required are as follows:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n(a)\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n(b)\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n(c)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nTypewriter\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nAnswering machine\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\nProjector\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n2009/10\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nResidual value b/f\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\nDisposal value at 30.11.2001 (see [EIM36690](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM36500#EIM36690))\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n100\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n130\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n(20)\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n(58)\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n1.  gives rise to a balancing charge of &#xA3;18 (&#xA3;20 as above, less 10% private use)\n2.  gives rise to a balancing allowance of &#xA3;27 (&#xA3;30 as above, less 10% private use)\n3.  gives rise to balancing charge of &#xA3;48 (although the difference above is &#xA3;58, the charge is restricted by the amount that the disposal value exceeded the original cost - see [EIM36680](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM36500#EIM36680)).","breadcrumbs":["EIMANUAL","EIM36500","EIM36930"],"sections":[]}}
