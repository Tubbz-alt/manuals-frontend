{"title":"The taxation of pension income: Amount of pension income charged to tax","details":{"manual-section-id":"EIM74101","slug": "guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74101","body":"The amount of taxable pension income is determined by reference to the relevant Chapter of ITEPA 2003 that applies to the pension or annuity in question. In many cases, the taxable pension income for a tax year is the amount accruing in that year irrespective of when any amount is actually paid. Where accruals basis applies, the pension, etc. should be assessed on the amounts that the pensioner is **entitled **to in the tax year\n\nPensioners are often content to pay income tax on the amount received in a year, as, in most years the amounts accruing and received are similar. However, it is possible in certain circumstances for the amounts to be different. If a taxpayer requests the statutory basis this should be accepted.\n\nThe following table shows how to find the amount of taxable pension income for different categories of pension income.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Type of income\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n### Amount taxable\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>United Kingdom pensions (see [EIM74003](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74003)) </td>\n<td>Full amount accruing in the tax year </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foreign pensions </td>\n<td>See [EIM74500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74500)&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>United Kingdom social security pensions </td>\n<td>Full amount accruing in the tax year (see [EIM74600](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74600)) </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pensions or annuities, etc. from approved retirement benefits schemes (see [EIM74009](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74009)) for 2005-06 and earlier </td>\n<td>Full amount accruing in the tax year </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Annuities paid under former approved superannuation funds (see [EIM74009](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74009)) for 2005-06 and earlier</td>\n<td>Full amount paid in the tax year </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Annuities, etc. from approved personal pension schemes (see [EIM74009](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74009)) for 2005-06 and earlier </td>\n<td>Full amount of annuity received or income withdrawn in the tax year </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pensions (including annuities and income withdrawals) under registered pension schemes (see [EIM74014](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74014)) for 2006-07 onwards</td>\n<td>Full amount accruing in the tax year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certain lump sums under registered pension schemes (see [EIM74014](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74014)) for 2006-07 onwards</td>\n<td>Depending on circumstances either full amount or 750f full amount paid in the tax year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Annuities under retirement annuity contracts (see [EIM74007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74007)) for 2005-06 and earlier </td>\n<td>Full amount of annuity arising in the tax year </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other employment related annuities (see [EIM74007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74007)): UK annuities </td>\n<td>Full amount of annuity arising in the tax year </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other employment related annuities (see [EIM74007](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74007)): Foreign annuities </td>\n<td>See [EIM74500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74500)&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Certain overseas government pensions paid in the United Kingdom (see [EIM74006](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74006))</td>\n<td>Full amount accruing in the tax year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The House of Commons Members Fund (see [EIM74309](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74309))</td>\n<td>Total amount of payments made in the tax year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return of surplus employee additional voluntary contributions (see [EIM74013](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74013)) for 2005-06 and earlier</td>\n<td>Total amount or value of payments made in the tax year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pre-1973 pensions paid under OPA 1973 </td>\n<td>See [EIM74500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74500)&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Voluntary annual payments: UK source (see [EIM74011](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74011))</td>\n<td>Full amount accruing in the tax year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Voluntary annual payments: Foreign source (see [EIM74011](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74011))</td>\n<td>See [EIM74500](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74500)&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n[EIM74102](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM74000#EIM74102)has examples of how the accruals basis applies where pensions are paid in advance.
