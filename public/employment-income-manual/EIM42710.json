{"title":"# Waivers of remuneration: more detail","details":{"manual-section-id":"EIM42710","body":"# Waivers of remuneration: more detail\n\nFor an overview of waivers of remuneration see [EIM42705](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/eimanual/EIM42705.htm).\n\nA waiver can be of fees and bonuses as well as salary.\n\nThe crucial factor for tax purposes is whether the remuneration waived is given up before it is treated as received for employment income purposes. Once a director or employee is treated as having received money earnings (see [EIM42260](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM42200#EIM42260) onwards):\n\n* PAYE is deductible\n* they are taxable earnings of the employee and\n* the employer is entitled to a deduction for them in computing the profits of its business.\n\nA subsequent waiver of remuneration will neither reduce the amount of remuneration subject to PAYE nor the amount of taxable earnings. For more detail on this point see [EIM42715](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM42715).\n\nThe link established by Finance Act 1989 between the time when employers can obtain a deduction for earnings in computing their business profits and the deduction of PAYE from them, should result in companies not voting remuneration that they are unable to pay.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
