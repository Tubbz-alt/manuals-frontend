There might also be increased charges for Internet access, home contents insurance or business telephone calls. Where working at home leads to a liability for business rates the additional cost incurred can also be included.\n\nThe additional household costs must be reasonable and must be incurred in carrying out the duties. This excludes costs that would be the same whether or not the employee works at home, for example mortgage interest, rent, council tax or water rates. It also excludes expenses that put the employee into a position to work at home, for example building alterations or the cost of furniture or office equipment.\n\nFor guidance on the amounts that can be reimbursed see [EIM01476](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM01476).\n\nAs regards broadband internet charges, see [EIM01475](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM01475).\n\nFor an example see [EIM01478](/guidance/employment-income-manual/EIM01478).\n\nAs regards NICs, see NIM05682.","breadcrumbs":[],"sections":[]}}
